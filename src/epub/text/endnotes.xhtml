				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1–20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza 1 the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she belongs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. <i>Holy</i>: omitted in <i>Regius</i>; the phrase “holy races” probably means little more than mankind in general. <i>Heimdall</i>: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall’s sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various attributes, and in the <i>Rigsthula</i>, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. <i>Rigsthula</i>, introductory prose and note). <i>Valfather</i> (“Father of the Slain”): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at Valhall (“Hall of the Slain”) by the Valkyries (“Choosers of the Slain”). <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Nine worlds</i>: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain). <i>The tree</i>: the world-ash Yggdrasil, symbolizing the universe; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29–35 and notes, wherein Yggdrasil is described at length. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Ymir</i>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 21. In this stanza as quoted in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> the first line runs:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>
								<span>“Of old was the age</span>
								<span>ere aught there was.”</span>
							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><i>Yawning gap</i>: this phrase, “Ginnunga-gap,” is sometimes used as a proper name. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Bur’s sons</i>: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in <i>Lokasenna</i>, 26. <i>Mithgarth</i> (“Middle Dwelling”): the world of men. <i>Leeks</i>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 7). <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3–5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon as daughter and son of Mundilferi, cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 23 and note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 37 and note. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines 1–2 are identical with lines 1–2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Ithavoll</i> (“Field of Deeds”?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Tables</i>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske’s “Chess in Iceland.” <i>Giant-maids</i>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20 and note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9–16), may have explained the “giant-maids” otherwise than as Norns. In <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 49, the Norns (this time “three throngs” instead of simply “three”) are spoken of as giant-maidens; <i>Fafnismol</i>, 13, indicates the existence of many lesser Norns, belonging to various races. <i>Jotunheim</i>: the world of the giants. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a somewhat changed order. <i>Brimir</i> and <i>Blain</i>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning “the bloody moisture” and Blain being of uncertain significance. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (“North,” “South,” “East,” and “West”), Althjof (“Mighty Thief”), Mjothvitnir (“Mead-Wolf”), Gandalf (“Magic Elf”), Vindalf (“Wind Elf”), Rathsvith (“Swift in Counsel”), Eikinskjaldi (“Oak Shield”), etc., but in many cases the interpretations are sheer guesswork. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. <i>Regin</i>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the <i>Reginsmol</i> and <i>Fafnismol</i>, but cf. note on <i>Reginsmol</i>, introductory prose. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Dvalin</i>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in <i>Fafnismol</i>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>; of <i>Lofar</i> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Andvari</i>: this dwarf appears prominently in the <i>Reginsmol</i>, which tells how the god Loki treacherously robbed him of his wealth; the curse which he laid on his treasure brought about the deaths of Sigurth, Gunnar, Atli, and many others. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word “three” in stanzas 8 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. <i>Ask</i> and <i>Embla</i>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Hönir</i>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and that he survives the destruction, assuming in the new age the gift of prophesy (cf. stanza 63). He was given by the gods as a hostage to the Wanes after their war, in exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note). <i>Lothur</i>: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but ingenious son of Laufey, whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Yggdrasil</i>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29–35 and notes. <i>Urth</i> (“The Past”): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-17" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>The maidens</i>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. <i>Dwelling</i>: <i>Regius</i> has “sæ” (sea) instead of “sal” (hall, home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri’s prose paraphrase indicates “sal.” <i>Urth</i>, <i>Verthandi</i> and <i>Skuld</i>: “Past,” “Present” and “Future.” <i>Wood</i>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood. Lines 3–4 are probably interpolations from some other account of the Norns. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This follows stanza 20 in <i>Regius</i>; in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40 and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. <i>The war</i>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the “war.” Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. <i>I remember</i>: the manuscripts have “she remembers,” but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. <i>Gollveig</i> (“Gold-Might”): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill-treatment being the immediate cause of the war. Müllenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5–6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. <i>Hor</i> (“The High One”): Othin. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-19" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Heith</i> (“Shining One”?): a name often applied to wise-women and prophetesses. The application of this stanza to Gollveig is far from clear, though the reference may be to the magic and destructive power of gold. It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas 1 ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-21" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25–26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44, note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. <i>Oth’s bride</i>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who “went away on long journeys.” <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-22" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Thor</i>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth); cf. particularly <i>Harbarthsljoth</i> and <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>Oaths</i>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused the undying hatred of the giants’ race, and thus the giants were among their enemies in the final battle. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-23" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin’s own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27–29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. <i>The horn of Heimdall</i>: the Gjallarhorn (“Shrieking Horn”), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. <i>Valfather’s pledge</i>: Othin’s eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter’s wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin’s sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin’s relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts <i>I know</i> and <i>I see</i> appear as “she knows” and “she sees” (cf. note on 21). <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-23" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-24" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The <i>Hauksbok</i> version omits all of stanzas 28–34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. <i>Regius</i> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated “would you know yet more?” seems to mean: “I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?” <i>The Old One</i>: Othin. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-24" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-25" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri’s paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-25" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-26" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1–29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31–66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it after stanza 28 as the third stanza of the poem. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscripts, and editors have attempted various emendations. <i>Heerfather</i> (“Father of the Host”): Othin. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-26" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-27" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Valkyries</i>: these “Choosers of the Slain” (cf. stanza 1, note) bring the bravest warriors killed in battle to Valhall, in order to re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They are also called “Wish-Maidens,” as the fulfillers of Othin’s wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note), Svava (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 36. <i>Ranks of the gods</i>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. <i>Herjan</i> (“Leader of Hosts”): Othin. It is worth noting that the name <i>Hild</i> (“Warrior”) is the basis of Bryn-hild (“Warrior in Mail-Coat”). <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-27" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-28" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Baldr</i>: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to be a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr’s blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-28" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-29" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, <span class="corr" id="xd32e2081" title="Source: lacunae">lacunæ</span> having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. <i>The brother of Baldr</i>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr’s death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-29" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-30" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in <i>Fensalir</i> (“the sea-halls”) symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-30" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-31" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The translation here follows the <i>Regius</i> version. The <i>Hauksbok</i> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first pair has,</p>

							</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from <i>Regius</i>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki’s other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki’s head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki’s wife, <i>Sigyn</i>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. “And there he lies bound till the end.” Cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, concluding prose. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-31" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-32" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Stanzas 36–39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38–39). The <i>Hauksbok</i> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. <i>Regius</i> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. <i>Slith</i> (“the Fearful”): a river in the giants’ home. The “swords and daggers” may represent the icy cold. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-32" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-33" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><i>Nithavellir</i> (“the Dark Fields”): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be “Nithafjoll” (“the Dark Crags”). <i>Sindri</i>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. <i>Okolnir</i> (“the Not Cold”): possibly a volcano. <i>Brimir</i>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-33" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version.

Here the wicked undergo tortures. <i>Smoke-vent</i>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-34" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-35" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1–3 the remains of a full stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4–5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of criminals known to Old Norse morality—oath-breakers and murderers. <i>Nithhogg</i> (“the Dread Biter”): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 32, 35. <i>The wolf</i>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf “out of six things: the noise of a cat’s step, the beards of women, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fishes, and the spittle of birds.” The chaining of Fenrir cost the god Tyr his right hand; cf. stanza 44. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-35" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-36" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The <i>Hauksbok</i> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain-stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. <i>The giantess</i>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse-myth. <a href="voluspo.xhtml#noteref-36" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-37" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>In the third line many editors omit the comma after “sun,” and put one after “soon,” making the two lines run:</p>

					<p>With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this.

Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed—again with a change of verse-form—by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85–90).

The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring. <a href="hovamol.xhtml#noteref-97" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Urth (“the Past”) is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later.

The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem.

					<p>With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the <i>Hovamol</i>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the <i>Ljothatal</i>, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: “Othin’s Tale of the Runes.” Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104–110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. <i>The windy tree</i>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally “the Horse of Othin,” so called because of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear.

					<p>This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin’s winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin’s grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104–110).

					<p>This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one “writes” and “tints” (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one “asks” and the sacrifices which one “offers” and “sends.” Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here.

					<p>In both manuscripts, apparently through the carelessness of some older copyist, stanzas 40 and 41 are run together: “Eleventh answer me well, what men in the home mightily battle each day?

The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 10–16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27–28 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name <i>Rin</i>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubtless purely accidental. <a href="grimnismol.xhtml#noteref-187" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-189" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs beneath them. “The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth’s well.” (Cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 19) “There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods’ Bridge.” Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza. Lines 3–4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30. <a href="grimnismol.xhtml#noteref-189" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It is noteworthy that gold was one of the attributes of Heimdall’s belongings, and, because his teeth were of gold, he was also called Gullintanni (“Gold-Toothed”). <i>Lettfeti</i>: “Light-Feet.” Othin’s eight-footed horse, Sleipnir, is not mentioned in this list. <a href="grimnismol.xhtml#noteref-190" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza 29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> thus: “An eagle sits in the branches of the ash-tree, and he is very wise; and between his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.” <a href="grimnismol.xhtml#noteref-191" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart mentioned in stanza 26, just as the list of dragons in stanza 34 seems to have been expanded out of Nithhogg, the only authentic dragon under the root of the ash. <i>Highest twigs</i>: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling.

According to Snorri: “There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim. The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows to cool them, and in some songs these are called ‘the cold iron.’ ” <a href="grimnismol.xhtml#noteref-197" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari’s aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward—Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. <i>Bilrost</i>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. <i>Bragi</i>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the <i>Edda</i>. In Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth.

Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone. But Thjalfi, Thor’s servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it. The hammer Mjollnir shattered both the grindstone and Hrungnir’s head, but part of the grindstone knocked Thor down, and the giant fell with his foot on Thor’s neck (cf. note on stanza 9).

					<p>The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor’s eastward journey. He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night. Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir’s lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in <i>Hovamol</i>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went.

On Ægir cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 45, and <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 1. <i>Frigg</i>: though Othin’s wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 34, <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 1, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, introductory prose. <i>Thor</i>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor’s movements; the “journey in the East” here mentioned cannot be the one described in the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor throughout that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. <i>Sif</i>: concerning Thor’s wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 48. <i>Bragi</i>: the god of poetry; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44 and note. <i>Ithun</i>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on <i>Skirnismol</i>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 19 (q. v.). <i>Tyr</i>: the god of battle; cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) <i>Voluspo</i>, 39, note. <i>Njorth</i>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of <i>Freyr</i> and <i>Freyja</i>; cf.

The work being nearly done, and the gods fearing to lose Freyja and the sun and moon, Loki turned himself into a mare, and so effectually distracted Svathilfari from his task that shortly afterwards Loki gave birth to Othin’s eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. In such contests of abuse a man was not infrequently taunted with having borne children; cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 39–45.

					<p>Loki’s taunt that Thor hid in the thumb of Skrymir’s glove is similar to that of Othin, <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 26, in the note to which the story is outlined. Line 4 is identical with line 3 of <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 26. <a href="lokasenna.xhtml#noteref-357" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>On the day following the adventure of the glove, Thor, Loki and Thor’s servants proceed on their way in company with Skrymir, who puts all their food in his wallet. At evening Skrymir goes to sleep, and Thor tries to get at the food, but cannot loosen the straps of the wallet. In a rage he smites Skrymir three times on the head with his hammer, but the giant—who, it subsequently appears, deftly dodges the blows—is totally undisturbed. Line 5 may well be spurious. <a href="lokasenna.xhtml#noteref-359" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Snorri tells the same story, with minor differences, but makes it the consequence of Loki’s part in the slaying of Baldr, which undoubtedly represents the correct tradition. The compiler of the poems either was confused or thought the incident was useful as indicating what finally happened to Loki. Possibly he did not mean to imply that Loki’s fate was brought upon him by his abuse of the gods, but simply tried to round out the story. <i>Franang</i>: “Gleaming Water.” <i>Vali</i> and <i>Narfi</i>: cf. stanza 49 and note. <i>Sigyn</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 35, the only other place where she is mentioned in the poems. Snorri omits the naive note about earthquakes, his narrative ending with the words, “And there he lies till the destruction of the gods.” <a href="lokasenna.xhtml#noteref-361" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
