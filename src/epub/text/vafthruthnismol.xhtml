						<p class="first">The <i>Vafthruthnismol</i> follows the <i>Hovamol</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, the first part evidently having appeared on a leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.</p>
						<p>The poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god’s turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: “What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?” Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.</p>
						<p>The whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the <i>Prose Edda</i>. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the <i>Grimnismol</i> and the much later <i>Alvissmol</i> represent different phases of the same type. The <i>Vafthruthnismol</i> and <i>Grimnismol</i> together, indeed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the <i>Voluspo</i>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.</p>

						<p class="first" id="n1.3.1"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.1">1</a>.</span> The phrases “Othin spake,” “Frigg spake,” etc., appear in abbreviated form in both manuscripts. <i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 34 and note. <i>Vafthruthnir</i> (“the Mighty in Riddles”): nothing is known of this giant beyond what is told in this poem.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.2"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.2">2</a>.</span> <i>Heerfather</i> (“Father of the Host”): Othin.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.5"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.5">5</a>.</span> This single narrative stanza is presumably a later interpolation. <i>Im</i>: the name appears to be corrupt, but we know nothing of any son of Vafthruthnir. <i>Ygg</i> (“the Terrible”): Othin.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.8"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.8">8</a>.</span> <i>Gagnrath</i> (“the Gain-Counsellor”): Othin on his travels always assumes a name other than his own.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.10"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.10">10</a>.</span> This stanza sounds very much like many of those in the first part of the <i>Hovamol</i>, and may have been introduced here from some such source.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.12"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.12">12</a>.</span> <i>Skinfaxi</i>: “Shining-Mane.”</p>
						<p id="n1.3.13"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.13">13</a>.</span> Here, and in general throughout the poem, the two-line introductory formulæ are abbreviated in the manuscripts.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.14"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.14">14</a>.</span> <i>Hrimfaxi</i>: “Frosty-Mane.”</p>
						<p id="n1.3.16"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.16">16</a>.</span> <i>Ifing</i>: there is no other reference to this river, which never freezes, so that the giants cannot cross it.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.17"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.17">17</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: the ruler of the fire-world (Muspellsheim), who comes to attack the gods in the last battle; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 52.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.18"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.18">18</a>.</span> <i>Vigrith</i>: “the Field of Battle.” Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>A hundred miles</i>: a general phrase for a vast distance.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.19"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.19">19</a>.</span> With this stanza Vafthruthnir, sufficiently impressed with his guest’s wisdom to invite him to share his own seat, resigns the questioning to Othin.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.20"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.20">20</a>.</span> The fragmentary version of this poem in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> begins in the middle of the first line of this stanza.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.21"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.21">21</a>.</span> <i>Ymir</i>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 3 and note.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.22"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.22">22</a>.</span> In this and in Othin’s following questions, both manuscripts replace the words “next,” “third,” “fourth,” etc., by Roman numerals.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.23"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.23">23</a>.</span> <i>Mundilferi</i> (“the Turner”?): known only as the father of Mani (the Moon) and Sol (the Sun). Note that, curiously enough, Mani is the boy and Sol the girl. According to Snorri, Sol drove the horses of the sun, and Mani those of the moon, for the gods, indignant that they should have been given such imposing names, took them from their father to perform these tasks. Cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 37.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.25"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.25">25</a>.</span> <i>Delling</i> (“the Dayspring”? Probably another form of the name, Dogling, meaning “Son of the Dew” is more correct): the husband of Not (Night); their son was Dag (Day); cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 161. <i>Nor</i>: Snorri calls the father of Night Norvi or Narfi, and puts him among the giants. Lines 3–4: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 6.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.27"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.27">27</a>.</span> Neither the <i>Regius</i> nor the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> indicates a lacuna. Most editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts: “And both of these   |   shall ever be, / Till the gods to destruction go.” Bugge ingeniously paraphrases Snorri’s prose: “Vindsval’s father   |   was Vosuth called, / And rough is all his race.” <i>Vindsval</i>: “the Wind-Cold,” also called Vindljoni, “the Wind-Man.” <i>Svosuth</i>: “the Gentle.”</p>
						<p id="n1.3.28"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.28">28</a>.</span> <i>Ymir’s kin</i>: the giants.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.29"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.29">29</a>.</span> <i>Bergelmir</i>: when the gods slew Ymir in order to make the world out of his body, so much blood flowed from him that all the frost-giants were drowned except Bergelmir and his wife, who escaped in a boat; cf. stanza 35. Of <i>Thruthgelmir</i> (“the Mightily Burning”) we know nothing, but Aurgelmir was the frost-giants’ name for Ymir himself. Thus Ymir was the first of the giants, and so Othin’s question is answered.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.31"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.31">31</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza, and the last two lines are taken from his version, as both of the manuscripts omit them. <i>Elivagar</i> (“Stormy Waves”): Mogk suggests that this river may have been the Milky Way. At any rate, the venom carried in its waters froze into ice-banks over Ginnunga-gap (the “yawning gap” referred to in <i>Voluspo</i>, 3), and then dripped down to make the giant Ymir.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.33"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.33">33</a>.</span> Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir’s son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Hymir’s mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 8. Of the career of Ymir’s six-headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.35"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.35">35</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Bergelmir</i>: on him and his boat cf. stanza 29 and note.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.37"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.37">37</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Hræsvelg</i> (“the Corpse-Eater”): on this giant in eagle’s form cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 50, and <i>Skirnismol</i>, 27.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.38"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.38">38</a>.</span> With this stanza the question-formula changes, and Othin’s questions from this point on concern more or less directly the great final struggle. Line 4 is presumably spurious. <i>Njorth</i>: on Njorth and the Wanes, who gave him as a hostage to the gods at the end of their war, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.40"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.40">40</a>.</span> In both manuscripts, apparently through the carelessness of some older copyist, stanzas 40 and 41 are run together: “Eleventh answer me well, what men in the home mightily battle each day? They fell each other, and fare from the fight all healed full soon to sit.” Luckily Snorri quotes stanza 41 in full, and the translation is from his version. Stanza 40 should probably run something like this: “Eleventh answer me well,   |   if thou knowest all / The fate that is fixed for the gods: / What men are they   |   who in Othin’s home / Each day to fight go forth?”</p>
						<p id="n1.3.41"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.41">41</a>.</span> <i>The heroes</i>: those brought to Valhall by the Valkyries. After the day’s fighting they are healed of their wounds and all feast together.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.43"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.43">43</a>.</span> <i>Nine worlds</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 2. <i>Niflhel</i>: “Dark-Hell.”</p>
						<p id="n1.3.44"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.44">44</a>.</span> <i>The mighty winter</i>: Before the final destruction three winters follow one another with no intervening summers.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.45"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.45">45</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Hoddmimir’s wood</i>: probably this is the ash-tree Yggdrasil, which is sometimes referred to as “Mimir’s Tree,” because Mimir waters it from his well; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27 and note, and <i>Svipdagsmol</i>, 30 and note. Hoddmimir is presumably another name for Mimir. <i>Lif</i> (“Life”) and <i>Lifthrasir</i> (“Sturdy of Life”?): nothing further is known of this pair, from whom the new race of men is to spring.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.46"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.46">46</a>.</span> <i>Fenrir</i>: there appears to be a confusion between the wolf Fenrir (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note) and his son, the wolf Skoll, who steals the sun (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 40 and note).</p>
						<p id="n1.3.47"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.47">47</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Alfrothul</i> (“the Elf-Beam”): the sun.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.49"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.49">49</a>.</span> <i>Mogthrasir</i> (“Desiring Sons”): not mentioned elsewhere in the Eddic poems, or by Snorri. <i>The maidens</i>: apparently Norns, like the “giant-maids” in <i>Voluspo</i>, 8. These Norns, however, are kindly to men.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.50"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.50">50</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 52 and note.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.51"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.51">51</a>.</span> <i>Vithar</i>: a son of Othin, who slays the wolf Fenrir; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 54 and note. <i>Vali</i>: the son whom Othin begot to avenge Baldr’s death; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 33 and note. <i>Mothi</i> (“Wrath”) and <i>Magni</i> (“Might”): the sons of the god Thor, who after his death inherit his famous hammer, <i>Mjollnir</i>. Concerning this hammer cf. especially <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>Vingnir</i> (“the Hurler”): Thor. Concerning his death cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 56. This stanza is quoted by Snorri.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.53"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.53">53</a>.</span> <i>The wolf</i>: Fenrir; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 53 and 54.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.54"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.54">54</a>.</span> <i>His son</i>: Baldr. Bugge changes lines 3–4 to run: “What did Othin speak   |   in the ear of Baldr, / When to the bale-fire they bore him?” For Baldr’s death cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and note. The question is, of course, unanswerable save by Othin himself, and so the giant at last recognizes his guest.</p>
						<p id="n1.3.55"><span class="parNum"><a class="pginternal" href="#lg1.3.55">55</a>.</span> <i>Fated</i>: in stanza 19 Vafthruthnir was rash enough to wager his head against his guest’s on the outcome of the contest of wisdom, so he knows that his defeat means his death.</p>
