					<p>Introductory Note</p>
				</header>
				<p>The <i xml:lang="non">Lokasenna</i> is found only in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Regius</i>, where it follows the <i xml:lang="non">Hymiskvitha</i>; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.</p>
				<p>The poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the <i xml:lang="non">Lokasenna</i> consists chiefly of Loki’s taunts to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed in mythological lore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.</p>
				<p>The prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem closely to the <i xml:lang="non">Hymiskvitha</i>, much as the <i xml:lang="non">Reginsmol</i>, <i xml:lang="non">Fafnismol</i> and <i xml:lang="non">Sigrdrifumol</i> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue⁠—very like stage directions⁠—and provide a conclusion by relating Loki’s punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The <i xml:lang="non">Lokasenna</i> is certainly much older than the <i xml:lang="non">Hymiskvitha</i>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.</p>

				<p id="lokasenna-prose-1">Ægir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif, Thor’s wife, was there, and Bragi with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr’s servants Byggvir and Beyla. Many were there of the gods and elves.</p>
				<p>Ægir had two serving-men, Fimafeng and Eldir. Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir’s serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-313" id="noteref-313" epub:type="noteref">313</a></p>
