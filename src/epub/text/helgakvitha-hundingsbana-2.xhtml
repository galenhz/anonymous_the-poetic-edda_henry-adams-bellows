					<p>Introductory Note</p>
				</header>
				<p>As the general nature of the Helgi tradition has been considered in the introductory note to <i xml:lang="non">Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, it is necessary here to discuss only the characteristics of this particular poem. The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.</p>
				<p>It is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13⁠–⁠16) is specifically identified as coming from “the old Volsung lay.” What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.</p>
				<p>Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> (stanzas 1⁠–⁠4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi’s, in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding’s home in disguise. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> (stanzas 5⁠–⁠12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> (stanzas 13⁠–⁠16, the “old Volsung lay” group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> (stanzas 17⁠–⁠21), which may well be from the same poem as Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> (stanzas 22⁠–⁠27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> (stanzas 28⁠–⁠37) gives Dag’s speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi’s death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> (stanzas 39⁠–⁠50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun’s visit to him in the burial hill.</p>
				<p>Sijmons maintains that sections <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> comes, of course, from the “old Volsung lay.” This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.</p>
				<p>Were it not for sections <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> the poem would be little more than a battleground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun’s curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.</p>

					<p>King Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi’s foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and King Sigmund, and each slew the other’s kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were called Volsungs and Ylfings.</p>
					<p>Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King Hunding’s, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-669" id="noteref-669" epub:type="noteref">669</a></p>

					<p>Granmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin’s hill. He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings’ meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni’s daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding’s sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-682" id="noteref-682" epub:type="noteref">682</a></p>

					<p>Helgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar’s sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:</p>

There was a great battle, and all Granmar’s sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni’s son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs.
