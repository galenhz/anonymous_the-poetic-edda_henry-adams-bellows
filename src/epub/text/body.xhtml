<h2 class="main">GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily
available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than
the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work
of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only
versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published
about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and
Powell’s <i>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i>, reprinted in the Norrœna collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing
with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray,
was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist
only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years
ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by
Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence
on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard
Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering’s admirable translation, published
in 1892, and by the recent two-volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by
Andreas Heusler, 1914–1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and
Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical
form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars
as Mogk, Vigfusson, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii" class="pginternal">xii</a>]</span>Finnur Jonsson, Grundtvig, Bugge, Gislason, Hildebrand, Lüning, Sweet, Niedner, Ettmüller,
Müllenhoff, Edzardi, B. M. Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel,
Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach
of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the
original Old Norse.
</p>
<p>On the importance of the material contained in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions
in our very speech, and the <i>Poetic Edda</i> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the
greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races
which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its
historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the <i>Voluspo</i>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world
ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the <i>Hovamol</i>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical
Book of Proverbs; in the <i>Lokasenna</i>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often
broad; and in the <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and
most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel
to the German <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. The <i>Poetic Edda</i> is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including
some of the most remarkable poems which have been preserved to us from the period
before the pen and the printing-press replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition.
It is above all else the desire <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii" class="pginternal">xiii</a>]</span>to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and
the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present
translation.

<h3 class="main">WHAT IS THE POETIC EDDA?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Even if the poems of the so-called <i>Edda</i> were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly
struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries
would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious.
We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no
means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain
as to what an “Edda” is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its
application to this collection of poems more or less misleading.
</p>
<p>A brief review of the chief facts in the history of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts
of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very
extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures
and tropes of Norse poetic diction,—the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds
was appallingly complex in this respect,—and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly
a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the “Edda” of Snorri Sturluson, for at
the head of the copy of it in the <i>Uppsalabok</i>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri’s death,
which was in 1241, we find: “This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.”
This work, well known as the <i>Prose Edda</i>, Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> or the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiv">[<a href="#pb.xiv" class="pginternal">xiv</a>]</span><i>Younger Edda</i>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation
by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.
</p>
<p>Icelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this <i>Edda</i> or one resembling it to Snorri’s much earlier compatriot, Sæmund the Wise (1056–1133).
When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone’s
satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in
question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, Sæmund had done of the
same kind. The nature of Snorri’s book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related
a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances
Snorri’s chief sources of information, it was assumed that Sæmund must have written
or compiled a verse <i>Edda</i>—whatever an “Edda” might be—on which Snorri’s work was largely based.
</p>
<p>So matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered
a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete
or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great
was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought
<i>Edda</i> of Sæmund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as Sæmund’s
<i>Edda</i>, the <i>Elder Edda</i> or the <i>Poetic Edda</i> it has been known to this day.
</p>
<p>This precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the
<i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few
poems of similar character found elsewhere <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xv">[<a href="#pb.xv" class="pginternal">xv</a>]</span>have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as
in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the Arnamagnæan
collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six
of the poems in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, and one other, <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (<i>Rigsthula</i>, <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, <i>Grougaldr</i> and <i>Fjolsvinnsmol</i>, the last two here combined under the title of <i>Svipdagsmol</i>), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems
in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri’s
<i>Edda</i> contains one complete poem, the <i>Grottasongr</i>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included
in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur’s
rendering of Snorri’s work.
</p>
<p>From all this it is evident that the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or
less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or
with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland.
How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were
current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though
it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four
poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection,
which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant
Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the <i>Poetic Edda</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvi">[<a href="#pb.xvi" class="pginternal">xvi</a>]</span></p>
<p>But what does the word “Edda” mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption
was that the word somehow meant “Poetics,” which fitted Snorri’s treatise to a nicety,
but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation,
could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of
poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word “edda” used in one
of the poems, the <i>Rigsthula</i>, where, rather conjecturally, it means “great-grandmother.” The word exists in this
sense nowhere else in Norse literature, and Grimm’s suggestion of “Tales of a Grandmother,”
though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either
the prose or the verse work.
</p>
<p>At last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle:
that “Edda” is simply the genitive form of the proper name “Oddi.” Oddi was a settlement
in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years,
and, traditionally at least, also the home of Sæmund the Wise. That Snorri’s work
should have been called “The Book of Oddi” is altogether reasonable, for such a method
of naming books was common—witness the “Book of the Flat Island” and other early manuscripts.
That Sæmund may also have written or compiled another “Oddi-Book” is perfectly possible,
and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.
</p>
<p>It is, however, an open question whether or not Sæmund had anything to do with making
the collection, or any part of it, now known as the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvii">[<a href="#pb.xvii" class="pginternal">xvii</a>]</span>We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent
student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for
his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated
in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.
</p>
<p>All that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century
there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological
and heroic poems, that the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part
of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as
the <i>Poetic</i> or <i>Elder Edda</i> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything
more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the
title “Edda” are conjectural.

<h3 class="main">THE ORIGIN OF THE EDDIC POEMS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic
poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems
were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most
of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were first committed
to writing. In general the mythological poems are strongly heathen in character, and
as Christianity became generally accepted throughout Norway and Iceland early in the
eleventh century, it is altogether likely that most of the poems dealing with the
Norse gods antedate the year 1000. On the other hand, Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and
others have shown pretty conclusively from linguistic evidence that <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xviii">[<a href="#pb.xviii" class="pginternal">xviii</a>]</span>these poems cannot have assumed anything like their present form before the ninth
century. As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear
to be as late as 1100, but most of them clearly belong to the hundred years following
950. It is a fairly safe guess that the years between 900 and 1050 saw the majority
of the Eddic poems put into shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took
place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of
the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based, certainly
existed in Norway, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900. In
considering such poems it is essential to forget the present mode of composition,
whereby a poet at once fixes his thought and his style by means of writing, and to
remember that for at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the correct transmission
of many of the Eddic poems depended solely on accurate hearing and retentive memory.
</p>
<p>As to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question,
at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for
discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays
is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology
to guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the
Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of Völund from Germany, as also the great
mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki,
Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems
deal with the more important of these questions of origin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xix">[<a href="#pb.xix" class="pginternal">xix</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of the men who composed these poems,—“wrote” is obviously the wrong word,—we know
absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a
high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are “folk-poetry,”—whatever that may
be,—only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs;
they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only
the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study
of the art of poetry.
</p>
<p>Where the poems were composed is almost equally uncertain. The claims of Norway have
been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement
of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of
an Icelandic source for most of the poems plausible. The two Atli lays, with what
authority we do not know, bear in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> the superscription “the Greenland poem,” and internal evidence indicates that this
statement is correct. Certainly in one poem, the <i>Rigsthula</i>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable
part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in
most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars
claim nearly all the Eddic poems for these “Western Isles,” in sharp distinction from
Iceland; their arguments are commented on in the introductory note to the <i>Rigsthula</i>. However, as Iceland early came to be the true center of this Scandinavian island
world, it may be said that most of the evidence concerning the birthplace of the Eddic
poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xx">[<a href="#pb.xx" class="pginternal">xx</a>]</span>and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.

<h3 class="main">THE EDDA AND OLD NORSE LITERATURE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Within the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate
summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly
connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service
to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately
the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of that period occurred the
great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient
date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired
broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of
nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting
refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders.
This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf
Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their
compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of
the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.
</p>
<p>Of all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew
up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from
the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the
roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxi">[<a href="#pb.xxi" class="pginternal">xxi</a>]</span>of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000,
brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the
makers but also the students and recorders of history.
</p>
<p>The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature.
Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass
of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of
which has been preserved. Narrative prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a
passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers.
These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to
mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have
of Old Norse literature,—and the published part of it makes a formidable library,—originated
thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final
shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.
</p>
<p>After 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming
a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the
Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic
disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon
evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period
were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel;
the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.
</p>
<p>The mass of literature thus collected and written down <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxii">[<a href="#pb.xxii" class="pginternal">xxii</a>]</span>largely between 1150 and 1250 may be roughly divided into four groups. The greatest
in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way
from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements
to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group:
the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation,
and so on, almost uniformly characterized by an appalling complexity of figurative
language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and
the poems of the <i>Edda</i>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality
of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of
the <i>Edda</i>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems
are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works,
religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the
later period of learned activity.
</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc" class="pginternal">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">PRESERVATION OF THE EDDIC POEMS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral
transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and
some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little-related fragments.
To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>—Sæmund or another—was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often
supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records
existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiii">[<a href="#pb.xxiii" class="pginternal">xxiii</a>]</span>from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any
means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and
unified as we now have them.
</p>
<p>Under such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text
is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used
the text prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual
emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the <i>Edda</i>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive
use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and
Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text
in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the
accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as
to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire poem. For this reason, and
because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation
of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order
to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all
the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions,
many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which
appear to be interpolations.

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc" class="pginternal">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE VERSE-FORMS OF THE EDDIC POEMS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been
analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiv">[<a href="#pb.xxiv" class="pginternal">xxiv</a>]</span>exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make
clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally
in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (“Old Verse”), for convenience
sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the
same structure, each line being sharply divided by a cæsural pause into two half-lines,
and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented
ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration,
or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following
is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:
</p>
<div class="lgouter" lang="non">
<p class="line"><i>Vreiþr</i> vas <i>Ving</i>þórr,   |   es <i>vakna</i>þi
</p>
<p class="line">ok <i>síns</i> <i>ham</i>ars   |   of <i>sakna</i>þi;
</p>
<p class="line"><i>skegg</i> nam <i>hris</i>ta,   |   <i>skǫr</i> nam <i>dý</i>ja,
</p>
<p class="line">réþ <i>Jarþ</i>ar <i>burr</i>   |   <i>umb</i> at <i>þreif</i>ask.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the second form, the Ljothahattr (“Song Measure”), the first and third line of
each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no
cæsural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented
syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three
measure. The following is an example:
</p>
<div class="lgouter" lang="non">
<p class="line"><i>Ar</i> skal <i>rís</i>a   |   sás <i>an</i>nars <i>vill</i>
</p>
<p class="line xd32e703"><i>fé</i> eþa <i>fjǫr</i> <i>haf</i>a;
</p>
<p class="line"><i>ligg</i>jandi <i>ulfr</i>   |   sjaldan <i>láer</i> of <i>getr</i>
</p>
<p class="line xd32e703">né <i>sof</i>andi <i>maþr sigr</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (“Speech Measure”), a younger
verse-form than <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxv">[<a href="#pb.xxv" class="pginternal">xxv</a>]</span>either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines
by a cæsural pause, each half-line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes
four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following
is an example:
</p>
<div class="lgouter" lang="non">
<p class="line"><i>Horsk</i> vas <i>hús</i>freyja,   |   <i>hug</i>þi at <i>mann</i>viti,
</p>
<p class="line"><i>lag</i> heyrþi <i>orþ</i>a,   |   hvat á <i>laun</i> <i>máel</i>tu;
</p>
<p class="line">þá vas <i>vant</i> <i>vit</i>ri,   |   <i>vil</i>di þeim <i>hjalp</i>a:
</p>
<p class="line">skyldu of <i>sáe</i> <i>sig</i>la,   |   en <i>sjǫlf</i> né <i>kvamsk</i>at.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled <i>-kvitha</i> (<i>Thrymskvitha</i>, <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as “lay,” while a poem in Ljothahattr
is entitled <i>-mol</i> (<i>Grimnismol</i>, <i>Skirnismol</i>, etc.), which I have rendered as “ballad.” It is difficult to find any distinction
other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally
existed.
</p>
<p>Variations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted
to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as
possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version,
to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations.
The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the
original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. In translating
from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary
words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number
of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two
accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed
to rhyme interchangeably, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvi">[<a href="#pb.xxvi" class="pginternal">xxvi</a>]</span>but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only
with themselves (<i>e.g.</i>, I have allowed initial <i>s</i> or <i>st</i> to rhyme with <i>sk</i> or <i>sl</i>). In general, I have sought to preserve the effect of the original form whenever
possible without an undue sacrifice of accuracy. For purposes of comparison, the translations

<p class="first">The forms in which the proper names appear in this translation will undoubtedly perplex
and annoy those who have become accustomed to one or another of the current methods
of anglicising old Norse names. The nominative ending -r it has seemed best to omit
after consonants, although it has been retained after vowels; in Baldr the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvii">[<a href="#pb.xxvii" class="pginternal">xxvii</a>]</span>final -r is a part of the stem and is of course retained. I have rendered the Norse
þ by “th” throughout, instead of spasmodically by “d,” as in many texts: <i>e.g.</i>, Othin instead of Odin. For the Norse ø I have used its equivalent, “ö,” <i>e.g.</i>, Völund; for the ǫ I have used “o” and not “a,” <i>e.g.</i>, Voluspo, not Valuspa or Voluspa. To avoid confusion with accents the long vowel
marks of the Icelandic are consistently omitted, as likewise in modern Icelandic proper
names. The index at the end of the book indicates the pronunciation in each case.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That this translation may be of some value to those who can read the poems of the
<i>Edda</i> in the original language I earnestly hope. Still more do I wish that it may lead
a few who hitherto have given little thought to the Old Norse language and literature
to master the tongue for themselves. But far above either of these I place the hope
that this English version may give to some, who have known little of the ancient traditions
of what is after all their own race, a clearer insight into the glories of that extraordinary
past, and that I may through this medium be able to bring to others a small part of
the delight which I myself have found in the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>.

<h3 class="main"> <span class="sc">Introductory Note</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the beginning of the collection in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> stands the <i>Voluspo</i>, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most debated, of all the Eddic
poems. Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about
the year 1300, the <i>Hauksbok</i>, and many stanzas are included in the <i>Prose Edda</i> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version differs materially from that in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements.
On the whole, however, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas
in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> seems more logical than any of the wholesale “improvements” which have been undertaken.
</p>
<p>The general plan of the <i>Voluspo</i> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster
and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain “Volva,” or wise-woman, presumably bidding
her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world,
the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly
interpolated catalogue of dwarfs’ names, stanzas 10–16), of the first man and woman,
of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir,
or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27–29, as a further proof of her
wisdom, she discloses some of Othin’s own secrets and the details of his search for
knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then
turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This
final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight
with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it,
<i>ragna rök</i>, “the fate of the gods,” has become familiar, by confusion with the word <i>rökkr</i>, “twilight,” in the German <i lang="de">Götterdämmerung</i>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin
and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the
gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle
on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and “fire leaps high
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2" class="pginternal">2</a>]</span>about heaven itself” (stanzas 31–58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world
is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and “fields unsowed bear ripened
fruit” (stanzas 59–66).
</p>
<p>This final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the
date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems
almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza
which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the
evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments
of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the <i>Voluspo</i> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very
few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with
Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence
was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the <i>Voluspo</i> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the “Western
Isles,” in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and
yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different
religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.
</p>
<p>How much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition
and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing
for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser
errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The
poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were
quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did
not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put
into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is
only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has familiarized himself with
the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which
this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed
it.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n1.1.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22,
28 and 30 before stanzas 1–20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here,
seems logical. In stanza 1 the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers
him and demands a hearing. Evidently she belongs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza
2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power.
<i>Holy</i>: omitted in <i>Regius</i>; the phrase “holy races” probably means little more than mankind in general. <i>Heimdall</i>: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred
to as Heimdall’s sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall
seems to have had various attributes, and in the <i>Rigsthula</i>, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men,
a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we
do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. <i>Rigsthula</i>, introductory prose and note). <i>Valfather</i> (“Father of the Slain”): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors
were brought to him at Valhall (“Hall of the Slain”) by the Valkyries (“Choosers of
the Slain”).
</p>
<p id="n1.1.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Nine worlds</i>: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note),
of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim,
cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim),
and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the
ninth world is uncertain). <i>The tree</i>: the world-ash Yggdrasil, <span class="pageNum" id="pb4a">[<a href="#pb4a" class="pginternal">4</a>]</span>symbolizing the universe; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29–35 and notes, wherein Yggdrasil is described at length.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Ymir</i>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 21. In this stanza as quoted in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> the first line runs: “Of old was the age   |   ere aught there was.” <i>Yawning gap</i>: this phrase, “Ginnunga-gap,” is sometimes used as a proper name.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Bur’s sons</i>: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn;
cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in <i>Lokasenna</i>, 26. <i>Mithgarth</i> (“Middle Dwelling”): the world of men. <i>Leeks</i>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 7).
</p>
<p id="n1.1.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes
the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3–5 are quoted by Snorri.
In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon <span class="pageNum" id="pb5a">[<a href="#pb5a" class="pginternal">5</a>]</span>as daughter and son of Mundilferi, cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 23 and note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 37 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines
1–2 are identical with lines 1–2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here
from that later stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Ithavoll</i> (“Field of Deeds”?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of
the gods; it appears in no other connection.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Tables</i>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers,
has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske’s “Chess in Iceland.”
<i>Giant-maids</i>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20 and
note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing
passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9–16), may have explained
the “giant-maids” otherwise than as Norns. In <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 49, the Norns (this time “three throngs” instead of simply “three”) are spoken of
as giant-maidens; <span class="pageNum" id="pb6a">[<a href="#pb6a" class="pginternal">6</a>]</span><i>Fafnismol</i>, 13, indicates the existence of many lesser Norns, belonging to various races. <i>Jotunheim</i>: the world of the giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through
stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza
11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a somewhat
changed order. <i>Brimir</i> and <i>Blain</i>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names
for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with
the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper
nouns, Brimir meaning “the bloody moisture” and Blain being of uncertain significance.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere.
It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list.
The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came
from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance,
as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (“North,” “South,” “East,” and “West”), Althjof
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7a">[<a href="#pb7a" class="pginternal">7</a>]</span>(“Mighty Thief”), Mjothvitnir (“Mead-Wolf”), Gandalf (“Magic Elf”), Vindalf (“Wind
Elf”), Rathsvith (“Swift in Counsel”), Eikinskjaldi (“Oak Shield”), etc., but in many
cases the interpretations are sheer guesswork.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in
the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. <i>Regin</i>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part
in the <i>Reginsmol</i> and <i>Fafnismol</i>, but cf. note on <i>Reginsmol</i>, introductory prose.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Dvalin</i>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably
accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in <i>Fafnismol</i>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some
of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned,
but unexplained, in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>; of <i>Lofar</i> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb8a">[<a href="#pb8a" class="pginternal">8</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.1.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> <i>Andvari</i>: this dwarf appears prominently in the <i>Reginsmol</i>, which tells how the god Loki treacherously robbed him of his wealth; the curse which
he laid on his treasure brought about the deaths of Sigurth, Gunnar, Atli, and many
others.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however,
something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids
of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth
to create man and woman. The word “three” in stanzas 8 and 17 very likely confused
some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. <i>Ask</i> and <i>Embla</i>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but
says that the gods made this pair out of trees.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>Hönir</i>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company
with Othin and Loki, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb9a">[<a href="#pb9a" class="pginternal">9</a>]</span>that he survives the destruction, assuming in the new age the gift of prophesy (cf.
stanza 63). He was given by the gods as a hostage to the Wanes after their war, in
exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note). <i>Lothur</i>: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but ingenious son of Laufey,
whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently
had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally
distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly
created pair.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Yggdrasil</i>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29–35 and notes. <i>Urth</i> (“The Past”): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being
sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> <i>The maidens</i>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. <i>Dwelling</i>: <i>Regius</i> has “sæ” (sea) instead of “sal” (hall, home), and many editors have followed this
reading, although Snorri’s prose paraphrase indicates “sal.” <i>Urth</i>, <i>Verthandi</i> and <i>Skuld</i>: “Past,” “Present” and “Future.” <i>Wood</i>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces
of wood. Lines 3–4 are probably interpolations from some other account of the Norns.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb10a">[<a href="#pb10a" class="pginternal">10</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.1.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> This follows stanza 20 in <i>Regius</i>; in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40 and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have
attempted all sorts of rearrangements. <i>The war</i>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir)
seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores
of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship
of the older gods; hence the “war.” Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped
in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief
among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became
conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally
to have been water-deities. <i>I remember</i>: the manuscripts have “she remembers,” but the Volva is apparently still speaking
of her own memories, as in stanza 2. <i>Gollveig</i> (“Gold-Might”): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill-treatment
being the immediate cause of the war. Müllenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another
name for Freyja. Lines 5–6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize
the refining of gold by fire. <i>Hor</i> (“The High One”): Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Heith</i> (“Shining One”?): a name often applied to wise-women and prophetesses. The application
of this stanza to Gollveig is far from clear, though the reference may be to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb11a">[<a href="#pb11a" class="pginternal">11</a>]</span>magic and destructive power of gold. It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation.
Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it
the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas
1 ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts,
for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the
gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them,
as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza
24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their
hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas
25–26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction
by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the
sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid
progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant
by a trick, so that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb12a">[<a href="#pb12a" class="pginternal">12</a>]</span>work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44, note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him.
<i>Oth’s bride</i>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man
who “went away on long journeys.”
</p>
<p id="n1.1.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Thor</i>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth); cf. particularly <i>Harbarthsljoth</i> and <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>Oaths</i>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused
the undying hatred of the giants’ race, and thus the giants were among their enemies
in the final battle.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin’s
own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27–29). Bugge puts this stanza
after stanza 29. <i>The horn of Heimdall</i>: the Gjallarhorn (“Shrieking Horn”), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will
summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil.
<i>Valfather’s pledge</i>: Othin’s eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange
for the latter’s wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from
which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil.
Othin’s sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of
the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several
differing versions of the story of Othin’s relations with Mimir; another one, quite
incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts <i>I know</i> and <i>I see</i> appear as “she knows” and “she sees” (cf. note on 21).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13a">[<a href="#pb13a" class="pginternal">13</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.1.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> The <i>Hauksbok</i> version omits all of stanzas 28–34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40
and 41. <i>Regius</i> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza
22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin
directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come
to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his
doom. Her reiterated “would you know yet more?” seems to mean: “I have proved my wisdom
by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise
of the fate in store for you?” <i>The Old One</i>: Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri’s
paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin
for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1–29), is induced to proceed with her real
prophecy (stanzas 31–66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making
it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it <span class="pageNum" id="pb14a">[<a href="#pb14a" class="pginternal">14</a>]</span>after stanza 28 as the third stanza of the poem. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscripts,
and editors have attempted various emendations. <i>Heerfather</i> (“Father of the Host”): Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> <i>Valkyries</i>: these “Choosers of the Slain” (cf. stanza 1, note) bring the bravest warriors killed
in battle to Valhall, in order to re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They
are also called “Wish-Maidens,” as the fulfillers of Othin’s wishes. The conception
of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early
times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise
South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the
originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of
both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note), Svava (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different
list is given in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 36. <i>Ranks of the gods</i>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. <i>Herjan</i> (“Leader of Hosts”): Othin. It is worth noting that the name <i>Hild</i> (“Warrior”) is the basis of Bryn-hild (“Warrior in Mail-Coat”).
</p>
<p id="n1.1.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Baldr</i>: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters
to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created
things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15a">[<a href="#pb15a" class="pginternal">15</a>]</span>about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to be a sport for the
gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki,
the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr’s blind brother, Hoth, and guided
his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf.
<i>Baldrs Draumar</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by
editors, <span class="corr" title="Source: lacunae" id="xd32e2081">lacunæ</span> having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. <i>The brother of Baldr</i>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr’s death. The day after his birth
he fought and slew Hoth.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess,
and pointing out that her home in <i>Fensalir</i> (“the sea-halls”) symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> The translation here follows the <i>Regius</i> version. The <i>Hauksbok</i> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first <span class="pageNum" id="pb16a">[<a href="#pb16a" class="pginternal">16</a>]</span>pair has, “I know that Vali   |   his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then   |  
was Loki bound.” Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have
included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from <i>Regius</i>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels
of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki’s other son, Vali. A serpent
was fastened above Loki’s head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki’s wife, <i>Sigyn</i>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and
she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook
with his struggles. “And there he lies bound till the end.” Cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, concluding prose.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Stanzas 36–39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the
dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38–39). The <i>Hauksbok</i> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. <i>Regius</i> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. <i>Slith</i> (“the Fearful”): a river in the giants’ home. The “swords and daggers” may represent
the icy cold.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> <i>Nithavellir</i> (“the Dark Fields”): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be “Nithafjoll”
(“the Dark Crags”). <i>Sindri</i>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. <i>Okolnir</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb17a">[<a href="#pb17a" class="pginternal">17</a>]</span>(“the Not Cold”): possibly a volcano. <i>Brimir</i>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs
were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 38, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. <i>Nastrond</i> (“Corpse-Strand”): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked
undergo tortures. <i>Smoke-vent</i>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof
serving instead of a chimney.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation,
and is lacking in most of the late paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have
called lines 1–3 the remains of a full stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines
4–5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes
of criminals known to Old Norse morality—oath-breakers and murderers. <i>Nithhogg</i> (“the Dread Biter”): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at
its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 32, 35. <i>The wolf</i>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha
(the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods
with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf “out of six things: the <span class="pageNum" id="pb18a">[<a href="#pb18a" class="pginternal">18</a>]</span>noise of a cat’s step, the beards of women, the roots of mountains, the nerves of
bears, the breath of fishes, and the spittle of birds.” The chaining of Fenrir cost
the god Tyr his right hand; cf. stanza 44.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> The <i>Hauksbok</i> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain-stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and
41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself.
<i>The giantess</i>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are
the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon.
Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse-myth.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> In the third line many editors omit the comma after “sun,” and put one after “soon,”
making the two lines run: “Dark grows the sun   |   in summer soon, / Mighty storms—”
etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> In the <i>Hauksbok</i> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. <i>Eggther</i>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the
gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in <span class="pageNum" id="pb19a">[<a href="#pb19a" class="pginternal">19</a>]</span>the poems. <i>Fjalar</i>, the cock whose crowing wakes the giants for the final struggle.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> <i>Gollinkambi</i> (“Gold-Comb”): the cock who wakes the gods and heroes, as Fjalar does the giants.
<i>The rust-red bird</i>: the name of this bird, who wakes the people of Hel’s domain, is nowhere stated.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> This is a refrain-stanza. In <i>Regius</i> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before
stanzas 50 and 59. In the <i>Hauksbok</i> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated
form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the <i>Hauksbok</i> line 3 runs: “Farther I see   |   and more can say.” <i>Garm</i>: the dog who guards the gates of Hel’s kingdom; cf. <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>, 2 ff, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44. <i><span class="corr" title="Source: Gniparhellir" id="xd32e2232">Gnipahellir</span></i> (“the Cliff-Cave”): the entrance to the world of the dead. <i>The wolf</i>: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri, stanza 49 alone
being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the status of stanza 45. Lines
4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After line 5 the <i>Hauksbok</i> has a line running: “The world resounds,   |   the witch is flying.” Editors have
arranged these seven lines in various ways, with <span class="corr" title="Source: lacunae" id="xd32e2245">lacunæ</span> freely indicated. <i>Sisters’ sons</i>: in all Germanic countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be
particularly close.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb20a">[<a href="#pb20a" class="pginternal">20</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.1.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> <i>Regius</i> combines the first three lines of this stanza with lines 3, 2, and 1 of stanza 47
as a single stanza. Line 4, not found in <i>Regius</i>, is introduced from the <i>Hauksbok</i> version, where it follows line 2 of stanza 47. <i>The sons of Mim</i>: the spirits of the water. On Mim (or Mimir) cf. stanza 27 and note. <i>Gjallarhorn</i>: the “Shrieking Horn” with which Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, calls them to
the last battle.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> In <i>Regius</i> lines 3, 2, and 1, in that order, follow stanza 46 without separation. Line 4 is
not found in <i>Regius</i>, but is introduced from the <i>Hauksbok</i> version. <i>Yggdrasil</i>: cf. stanza 19 and note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29–35. <i>The giant</i>: Fenrir. <i>The head of Mim</i>: various myths were current about Mimir. This stanza refers to the story that he
was sent by the gods with Hönir as a hostage to the Wanes after their war (cf. stanza
21 and note), and that the Wanes cut off his head and returned it to the gods. Othin
embalmed the head, and by magic gave it the power of speech, thus making Mimir’s noted
wisdom always available. Of course this story does not fit with that underlying the
references to Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. <i>The kinsman of Surt</i>: the wolf <span class="pageNum" id="pb21a">[<a href="#pb21a" class="pginternal">21</a>]</span>Fenrir, who slays Othin in the final struggle; cf. stanza 53. Surt is the giant who
rules the fire-world, Muspellsheim; cf. stanza 52.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> This stanza in <i>Regius</i> follows stanza 51; in the <i>Hauksbok</i> it stands, as here, after 47. <i>Jotunheim</i>: the land of the giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> Identical with stanza 44. In the manuscripts it is here abbreviated.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> <i>Hrym</i>: the leader of the giants, who comes as the helmsman of the ship Naglfar (line 4).
<i>The serpent</i>: Mithgarthsorm, one of the children of Loki and Angrbotha (cf. stanza 39, note).
The serpent was cast into the sea, where he completely encircles the land; cf. especially
<i>Hymiskvitha</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>The eagle</i>: the giant Hræsvelg, who sits at the edge of heaven in the form of an eagle, and
makes the winds with his wings; cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 37, and <i>Skirnismol</i>, 27. <i>Naglfar</i>: the ship which was made out of dead men’s nails to carry the giants to battle.

<p id="n1.1.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> <i>North</i>: a guess; the manuscripts have “east,” but there seems to be a confusion with stanza
50, line 1. <i>People of Hel</i>: the manuscripts have “people of Muspell,” but these came over the bridge Bifrost
(the rainbow), which broke beneath them, whereas the people of Hel came in a ship
steered by Loki. <i>The wolf</i>: Fenrir. <i>The brother of Byleist</i>: Loki. Of Byleist (or Byleipt) no more is known.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.52"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.52" class="pginternal">52</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: the ruler of the fire-world. <i>The scourge of branches</i>: fire. This is one of the relatively rare instances in the Eddic poems of the type

<p id="n1.1.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> <i>Hlin</i>: apparently another name for Frigg, Othin’s wife. After losing her son Baldr, she
is fated now to see Othin slain by the wolf Fenrir. <i>Beli’s slayer</i>: the god Freyr, who killed the giant Beli with his fist; cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, 16 and note. On Freyr, who belonged to the race of the Wanes, and was the brother
of Freyja, see especially <i>Skirnismol</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>The joy of Frigg</i>: Othin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23a">[<a href="#pb23a" class="pginternal">23</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.1.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: “Fares Othin’s son   |  
to fight with the wolf.” <i>Sigfather</i> (“Father of Victory”): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for
his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor’s. He survives
the destruction. <i>The giant’s son</i>: Fenrir.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.55"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.55" class="pginternal">55</a>.</span> This and the following stanza are clearly in bad shape. In <i>Regius</i> only lines 1 and 4 are found, combined with stanza 56 as a single stanza. Line 1
does not appear in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version, the stanza there beginning with line 2. Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas,
omits 55, 2–4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, 1, and 56, 4, 2, 1, in
that order. Moreover, the <i>Hauksbok</i> manuscript at this point is practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course,
purely conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been attempted
by editors. <i>Hlothyn</i>: another name for Jorth (“Earth”), Thor’s mother; his father was Othin. <i>The snake</i>: Mithgarthsorm; cf. stanza 5c and note. <i>Othin’s son</i>: Thor. The fourth line in <i>Regius</i> reads “against the wolf,” but if this line refers to Thor at all, and not to Vithar,
the <i>Hauksbok</i> reading, “serpent,” is correct.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.56"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.56" class="pginternal">56</a>.</span> <i>The warder of earth</i>: Thor. <i>The son of Fjorgyn</i>: again <span class="pageNum" id="pb24a">[<a href="#pb24a" class="pginternal">24</a>]</span>Thor, who, after slaying the serpent, is overcome by his venomous breath, and dies.
Fjorgyn appears in both a masculine and a feminine form. In the masculine it is a
name for Othin; in the feminine, as here and in <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 56, it apparently refers to Jorth.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.57"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.57" class="pginternal">57</a>.</span> With this stanza ends the account of the destruction.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.58"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.58" class="pginternal">58</a>.</span> Again the refrain-stanza (cf. stanza 44 and note), abbreviated in both manuscripts,
as in the case of stanza 49. It is probably misplaced here.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.59"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.59" class="pginternal">59</a>.</span> Here begins the description of the new world which is to rise out of the wreck of
the old one. It is on this passage that a few critics have sought to base their argument
that the poem is later than the introduction of Christianity (<i>circa</i> 1000), but this theory has never seemed convincing (cf. introductory note).
</p>
<p id="n1.1.60"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.60" class="pginternal">60</a>.</span> The third line of this stanza is not found in <i>Regius</i>. <i>Ithavoll</i>: cf. stanza 7 and note. <i>The girdler of earth</i>: Mithgarthsorm, <span class="pageNum" id="pb25a">[<a href="#pb25a" class="pginternal">25</a>]</span>who, lying in the sea, surrounded the land. <i>The Ruler of Gods</i>: Othin. The runes were both magic signs, generally carved on wood, and sung or spoken
charms.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.61"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.61" class="pginternal">61</a>.</span> The <i>Hauksbok</i> version of the first two lines runs:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The gods shall find there,   |   wondrous fair,
</p>
<p class="line">The golden tables   |   amid the grass.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">No lacuna (line 4) is indicated in the manuscripts. <i>Golden tables</i>: cf. stanza 8 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.62"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.62" class="pginternal">62</a>.</span> <i>Baldr</i>: cf. stanza 32 and note. Baldr and his brother, Hoth, who unwittingly slew him at
Loki’s instigation, return together, their union being a symbol of the new age of
peace. <i>Hropt</i>: another name for Othin. His “battle-hall” is Valhall.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.63"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.63" class="pginternal">63</a>.</span> No lacuna (line 2) indicated in the manuscripts. <i>Hönir</i>: cf. stanza 18 and note. In this new age he has the gift of foretelling the future.
<i>Tveggi</i> (“The Twofold”): another name for <span class="pageNum" id="pb26a">[<a href="#pb26a" class="pginternal">26</a>]</span>Othin. His brothers are Vili and Ve (cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 26, and note). Little is known of them, and nothing, beyond this reference, of their
sons. <i>Vindheim</i> (“Home of the Wind”): heaven.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.64"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.64" class="pginternal">64</a>.</span> This stanza is quoted by Snorri. <i>Gimle</i>: Snorri makes this the name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to
a mountain on which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to another
hall, not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri’s description of this second hall is
based on <i>Voluspo</i>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.65"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.65" class="pginternal">65</a>.</span> This stanza is not found in <i>Regius</i>, and is probably spurious. No lacuna is indicated in the <i>Hauksbok</i> version, but late paper manuscripts add two lines, running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Rule he orders,   |   and rights he fixes,
</p>
<p class="line">Laws he ordains   |   that ever shall live.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the suggestion of Christianity
is unavoidable. It is not certain, however, that even this stanza refers to Christianity,
and if it does, it may have been interpolated long after the rest of the poem was
composed.
</p>
<p id="n1.1.66"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.1.66" class="pginternal">66</a>.</span> This stanza, which fits so badly with the preceding ones, <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27" class="pginternal">27</a>]</span>may well have been interpolated. It has been suggested that the dragon, making a last
attempt to rise, is destroyed, this event marking the end of evil in the world. But
in both manuscripts the final half-line does not refer to the dragon, but, as the
gender shows, to the Volva herself, who sinks into the earth; a sort of conclusion
to the entire prophecy. Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line, which was
probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs somewhere in the description
of the great struggle. <i>Nithhogg</i>: the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. <i>Nithafjoll</i> (“the Dark Crags”); nowhere else mentioned. <i>Must I</i>: the manuscripts have “must she.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This poem follows the <i>Voluspo</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and
two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.
</p>
<p>In its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other
of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened
seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection
of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical
proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in
extent, was known as “The High One’s Words,” and forms the basis of the present poem.
To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed
by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or
charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from
those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative
crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter
to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have
as the <i>Hovamol</i>.
</p>
<p>Five separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the <i>Hovamol</i> proper (stanzas 1–80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life;
(2) the <i>Loddfafnismol</i> (stanzas 111–138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specifically addressed
to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the <i>Ljothatal</i> (stanzas 147–165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing’s
daughter (stanzas 96–102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness
of women in general (stanzas 81–95), which probably crept into the poem first, and
then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin
got the mead of poetry—the draught which gave him the gift of tongues—from the maiden
Gunnloth (stanzas 103–110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139–146) telling
how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the <i>Ljothatal</i>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29" class="pginternal">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this.
Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts
of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of
its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how
or when they first became associated.
</p>
<p>It seems all but meaningless to talk about “interpolations” in a poem which has developed
almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and
ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main
divisions of the poem distinct.
</p>
<p>Few gnomic collections in the world’s literary history present sounder wisdom more
tersely expressed than the <i>Hovamol</i>. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it
presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty,
truth, and unfaltering courage.</p>

of stanza 10.

</p>
<p id="n1.2.65"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.65" class="pginternal">65</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no lacuna (lines 1 and 2). Many editors have filled out
the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts, the passage running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“A man must be watchful   |   and wary as well,
</p>
<p class="line xd32e852">And fearful of trusting a friend.”</p>

<p class="first" id="n1.2.70"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.70" class="pginternal">70</a>.</span> The manuscript has “and a worthy life” in place of “than to lie a corpse” in line
1, but Rask suggested the emendation as early as 1818, and most editors have followed
him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43a">[<a href="#pb43a" class="pginternal">43</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.73"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.73" class="pginternal">73–74</a>.</span> These seven lines are obviously a jumble. The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear
out of place, but the verse-form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74,
the second line is clearly interpolated, and line 1 has little enough connection with
lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here
various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.75"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.75" class="pginternal">75</a>.</span> The word “gold” in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure.
The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb44a">[<a href="#pb44a" class="pginternal">44</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.76"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.76" class="pginternal">76</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza follows 78, the order being: 77, 78, 76, 80, 79, 81.
<i>Fitjung</i> (“the Nourisher”): Earth.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.79"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.79" class="pginternal">79</a>.</span> This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference
to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like
the <i>Ljothatal</i> (stanzas 147–165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something
has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no
lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Certain is that   |   which is sought from runes,
</p>
<p class="line xd32e852">The runes—,” etc.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb45a">[<a href="#pb45a" class="pginternal">45</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first" id="n1.2.81"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.81" class="pginternal">81</a>.</span> With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes
to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80
introduces the idea of man’s love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler
(or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas
concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of
stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza
84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed—again with a change
of verse-form—by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85–90). Then, after
a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the <i>Hovamol</i> (stanzas 91–95), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin’s story of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb46a">[<a href="#pb46a" class="pginternal">46</a>]</span>adventure with Billing’s daughter (stanzas 96–102). Some such process of growth, whatever
its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos
of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.84"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.84" class="pginternal">84</a>.</span> Lines 3 and 4 are quoted in the <i>Fostbræthrasaga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.85"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.85" class="pginternal">85</a>.</span> Stanzas 85–88 and 90 are in Fornyrthislag, and clearly come from a different source
from the rest of the <i>Hovamol</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.87"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.87" class="pginternal">87</a>.</span> The stanza is doubtless incomplete. Some editors add from a late paper manuscript
two lines running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In a light, clear sky   |   or a laughing throng,
</p>
<p class="line">In the howl of a dog   |   or a harlot’s grief.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb47a">[<a href="#pb47a" class="pginternal">47</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first" id="n1.2.88"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.88" class="pginternal">88</a>.</span> This stanza follows stanza 89 in the manuscript. Many editors have changed the order,
for while stanza 89 is pretty clearly an interpolation wherever it stands, it seriously
interferes with the sense if it breaks in between 87 and 88.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48a">[<a href="#pb48a" class="pginternal">48</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.96"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.96" class="pginternal">96</a>.</span> Here begins the passage (stanzas 96–102) illustrating the falseness of woman by the
story of Othin’s unsuccessful love-affair with Billing’s daughter. Of this person
we know nothing beyond what is here told, but the story needs little comment.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49a">[<a href="#pb49a" class="pginternal">49</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.102"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.102" class="pginternal">102</a>.</span> Rask adds at the beginning of this stanza two lines from a late paper manuscript,
running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Few are so good   |   that false they are never
</p>
<p class="line xd32e852">To cheat the mind of a man.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He makes these two lines plus lines 1 and 2 a full stanza, and lines 3, 4, 5, and
6 a second stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50a">[<a href="#pb50a" class="pginternal">50</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.103"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.103" class="pginternal">103</a>.</span> With this stanza the subject changes abruptly, and apparently the virtues of fair
speech, mentioned in the last three lines, account for the introduction, from what
source cannot be known, of the story of Othin and the mead of song (stanzas 104–110).
</p>
<p id="n1.2.104"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.104" class="pginternal">104</a>.</span> The giant <i>Suttung</i> (“the old giant”) possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift
of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way
through a mountain into Suttung’s home, made love to the giant’s daughter, Gunnloth,
and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle,
leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (“the
Evil-Doer”).
</p>
<p id="n1.2.105"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.105" class="pginternal">105</a>.</span> <i>Rati</i> (“the Traveller”): the gimlet with which Othin bored through the mountain to reach
Suttung’s home.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51a">[<a href="#pb51a" class="pginternal">51</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.106"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.106" class="pginternal">106</a>.</span> Probably either the fourth or the fifth line is a spurious addition.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.107"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.107" class="pginternal">107</a>.</span> <i>Othrörir</i>: here the name of the magic mead itself, whereas in stanza 141 it is the name of
the vessel containing it. Othin had no intention of bestowing any of the precious
mead upon men, but as he was flying over the earth, hotly pursued by Suttung, he spilled
some of it out of his mouth, and in this way mankind also won the gift of poetry.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.109"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.109" class="pginternal">109</a>.</span> <i>Hor</i>: Othin (“the High One”). The frost-giants, Suttung’s kinsmen, appear not to have
suspected Othin of being <span class="pageNum" id="pb52a">[<a href="#pb52a" class="pginternal">52</a>]</span>identical with Bolverk, possibly because the oath referred to in stanza 110 was an
oath made by Othin to Suttung that there was no such person as Bolverk among the gods.
The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning
Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths,
that sworn on his ring.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.111"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.111" class="pginternal">111</a>.</span> With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111–138). Loddfafnir is apparently
a wandering singer, who, from his “chanter’s stool,” recites the verses which he claims
to have received from Othin. <i>Wells of Urth</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 19 and note. Urth (“the Past”) is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently
in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting
lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as
though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had <span class="pageNum" id="pb53a">[<a href="#pb53a" class="pginternal">53</a>]</span>crept in later. The phrase translated “the speech of Hor” is “Hova mol,” later used
as the title for the entire poem.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.112"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.112" class="pginternal">112</a>.</span> Lines 1–3 are the formula, repeated (abbreviated in the manuscript) in most of the
stanzas, with which Othin prefaces his counsels to Loddfafnir, and throughout this
section, except in stanzas 111 and 138, Loddfafnir represents himself as simply quoting
Othin’s words. The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty
stanzas of the poem. In some cases (e.g., stanzas 117, 119, 121, 126 and 130) the
formula precedes a full four-line stanza instead of two (or three) lines.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57a">[<a href="#pb57a" class="pginternal">57</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.129"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.129" class="pginternal">129</a>.</span> Line 5 is apparently interpolated.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.131"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.131" class="pginternal">131</a>.</span> Lines 5–6 probably were inserted from a different poem.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58a">[<a href="#pb58a" class="pginternal">58</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.133"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.133" class="pginternal">133</a>.</span> Many editors reject the last two lines of this stanza as spurious, putting the first
two lines at the end of the preceding stanza. Others, attaching lines 3 and 4 to stanza
132, insert as the first two lines of stanza 133 two lines from a late paper manuscript,
running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Evil and good   |   do men’s sons ever
</p>
<p class="line xd32e852"><span id="xd32e5061"/>Mingled bear in their breasts.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first" id="n1.2.134"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.134" class="pginternal">134</a>.</span> Presumably the last four lines have been added to this stanza, for the parallelism
in the last three makes it probable that they belong together. The wrinkled skin of
the old man is <span class="pageNum" id="pb59a">[<a href="#pb59a" class="pginternal">59</a>]</span>compared with the dried skins and bellies of animals kept for various purposes hanging
in an Icelandic house.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.136"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.136" class="pginternal">136</a>.</span> This stanza suggests the dangers of too much hospitality. The beam (bolt) which is
ever being raised to admit guests becomes weak thereby. It needs a ring to help it
in keeping the door closed, and without the ability at times to ward off guests a
man becomes the victim of his own generosity.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.137"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.137" class="pginternal">137</a>.</span> The list of “household remedies” in this stanza is doubtless interpolated. Their
nature needs no comment here.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60a">[<a href="#pb60a" class="pginternal">60</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.138"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.138" class="pginternal">138</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza comes at the end of the entire poem, following stanza
165. Most recent editors have followed Müllenhoff in shifting it to this position,
as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza III.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.139"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.139" class="pginternal">139</a>.</span> With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the <i>Hovamol</i>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the <i>Ljothatal</i>, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: “Othin’s
Tale of the Runes.” Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account
of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of
the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104–110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are
from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes.
With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. <i>The windy tree</i>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally “the Horse of Othin,” so called because of this story),
on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to
himself, and wounded himself with his own spear. Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been
borrowed from <i>Svipdagsmol</i>, 30.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb61a">[<a href="#pb61a" class="pginternal">61</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.141"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.141" class="pginternal">141</a>.</span> This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin’s winning the runes, appears
to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin’s
grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned,
but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned
from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104–110).
Concerning <i>Othrörir</i>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.143"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.143" class="pginternal">143</a>.</span> This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single
stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines
2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge.
<i>The king of singers</i>: Othin. The magic signs (runes) were commonly carved in wood, then colored red.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62a">[<a href="#pb62a" class="pginternal">62</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.144"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.144" class="pginternal">144</a>.</span> <i>Dain</i> and <i>Dvalin</i>: dwarfs; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 14, and note. Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf
of that name. The two names also appear together in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 33, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs
of Yggdrasil. <i>Alsvith</i> (“the All-Wise”) appears nowhere else as a giant’s name. <i>Myself</i>: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the
runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in
the rather hazy mind of some reciter.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.145"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.145" class="pginternal">145</a>.</span> This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with
the runes which one “writes” and “tints” (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which
one “asks” and the sacrifices which one “offers” and “sends.” Its origin is wholly
uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here. In the manuscript the phrase “knowest?”
is abbreviated after the first line.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb63a">[<a href="#pb63a" class="pginternal">63</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.146"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.146" class="pginternal">146</a>.</span> This stanza as translated here follows the manuscript reading, except in assuming
a gap between lines 3 and 5. In Vigfusson and Powell’s <i lang="la">Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i> the first three lines have somehow been expanded into eight. The last two lines are
almost certainly misplaced; Bugge suggests that they belong at the end of stanza 144.
<i>Thund</i>: another name for Othin. <i>When home he came</i>: presumably after obtaining the runes as described in stanzas 139 and 140.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.147"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.147" class="pginternal">147</a>.</span> With this stanza begins the <i>Ljothatal</i>, or list of charms. The magic songs themselves are not given, but in each case the
peculiar application of the charm is explained. The passage, which is certainly approximately
complete as far as it goes, runs to the end of the poem. In the manuscript and in
most editions line 4 falls into two half-lines, running:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“In sickness and pain   |   and every sorrow.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb64a">[<a href="#pb64a" class="pginternal">64</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first" id="n1.2.148"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.148" class="pginternal">148</a>.</span> <i>Second</i>, etc., appear in the manuscript as Roman numerals. The manuscript indicates no gap
after line 2.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.152"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.152" class="pginternal">152</a>.</span> The sending of a root with runes written thereon was an excellent way of causing
death. So died the Icelandic hero Grettir the Strong.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb65a">[<a href="#pb65a" class="pginternal">65</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.156"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.156" class="pginternal">156</a>.</span> <i>House-riders</i>: witches, who ride by night on the roofs of houses, generally in the form of wild
beasts. Possibly one of the last two lines is spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.157"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.157" class="pginternal">157</a>.</span> The last line looks like an unwarranted addition, and line 4 may likewise be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.158"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.158" class="pginternal">158</a>.</span> Lines 4–5 are probably expanded from a single line.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb66a">[<a href="#pb66a" class="pginternal">66</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.159"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.159" class="pginternal">159</a>.</span> The sprinkling of a child with water was an established custom long before Christianity
brought its conception of baptism.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.161"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.161" class="pginternal">161</a>.</span> This stanza, according to Müllenhoff, was the original conclusion of the poem, the
phrase “a fifteenth” being inserted only after stanzas 162–165 had crept in. <i>Delling</i>: a seldom mentioned god who married Not (Night). Their son was Dag (Day). <i>Thjothrörir</i>: not mentioned elsewhere. <i>Hroptatyr</i>: Othin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67a">[<a href="#pb67a" class="pginternal">67</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.2.163"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.163" class="pginternal">163</a>.</span> Some editors have combined these two lines with stanza 164. Others have assumed that
the gap follows the first half-line, making “so that—from me” the end of the stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.164"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.164" class="pginternal">164</a>.</span> This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, and seems to have been introduced
after the list of charms and the <i>Loddfafnismol</i> (stanzas 111–138) were combined in a single poem, for there is no other apparent
excuse for the reference to Loddfafnir at this point. The words “if thou mightest
get them” are a conjectural emendation.
</p>
<p id="n1.2.165"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.2.165" class="pginternal">165</a>.</span> This stanza is almost totally obscure. The third and fourth lines look like interpolations.

<p class="first">The <i>Vafthruthnismol</i> follows the <i>Hovamol</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, the first part evidently having appeared on a leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight
stanzas of it in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.
</p>
<p>The poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5).
After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning
the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks
out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall
demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11,
13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god’s turn to ask, and
he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past
history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this
time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking
the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds
the unanswerable question: “What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in
the bale-fire he burned?” Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself,
admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.
</p>
<p>The whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly
useful to Snorri in his preparation of the <i>Prose Edda</i>. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly
popular; the <i>Grimnismol</i> and the much later <i>Alvissmol</i> represent different phases of the same type. The <i>Vafthruthnismol</i> and <i>Grimnismol</i> together, indeed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There
has been much discussion as to the probable date of the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the <i>Voluspo</i>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated
passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently
in relatively good condition.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n1.3.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The phrases “Othin spake,” “Frigg spake,” etc., appear in abbreviated form in both
manuscripts. <i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 34 and note. <i>Vafthruthnir</i> (“the Mighty in Riddles”): nothing is known of this giant beyond what is told in
this poem.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Heerfather</i> (“Father of the Host”): Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> This single narrative stanza is presumably a later interpolation. <span class="pageNum" id="pb70a">[<a href="#pb70a" class="pginternal">70</a>]</span><i>Im</i>: the name appears to be corrupt, but we know nothing of any son of Vafthruthnir.
<i>Ygg</i> (“the Terrible”): Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Gagnrath</i> (“the Gain-Counsellor”): Othin on his travels always assumes a name other than his
own.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71a">[<a href="#pb71a" class="pginternal">71</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> This stanza sounds very much like many of those in the first part of the <i>Hovamol</i>, and may have been introduced here from some such source.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>Skinfaxi</i>: “Shining-Mane.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72a">[<a href="#pb72a" class="pginternal">72</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Here, and in general throughout the poem, the two-line introductory formulæ are abbreviated
in the manuscripts.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Hrimfaxi</i>: “Frosty-Mane.”
</p>
<p id="n1.3.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Ifing</i>: there is no other reference to this river, which never freezes, so that the giants
cannot cross it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb73a">[<a href="#pb73a" class="pginternal">73</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: the ruler of the fire-world (Muspellsheim), who comes to attack the gods in the
last battle; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 52.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>Vigrith</i>: “the Field of Battle.” Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>A hundred miles</i>: a general phrase for a vast distance.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> With this stanza Vafthruthnir, sufficiently impressed with his guest’s wisdom to
invite him to share his own seat, resigns the questioning to Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The fragmentary version of this poem in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> begins in the middle of the first line of this stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb74a">[<a href="#pb74a" class="pginternal">74</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Ymir</i>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 3 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> In this and in Othin’s following questions, both manuscripts replace the words “next,”
“third,” “fourth,” etc., by Roman numerals.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Mundilferi</i> (“the Turner”?): known only as the father of Mani (the Moon) and Sol (the Sun). Note
that, curiously <span class="pageNum" id="pb75a">[<a href="#pb75a" class="pginternal">75</a>]</span>enough, Mani is the boy and Sol the girl. According to Snorri, Sol drove the horses
of the sun, and Mani those of the moon, for the gods, indignant that they should have
been given such imposing names, took them from their father to perform these tasks.
Cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 37.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> <i>Delling</i> (“the Dayspring”? Probably another form of the name, Dogling, meaning “Son of the
Dew” is more correct): the husband of Not (Night); their son was Dag (Day); cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 161. <i>Nor</i>: Snorri calls the father of Night Norvi or Narfi, and puts him among the giants.
Lines 3–4: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 6.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Neither the <i>Regius</i> nor the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> indicates a lacuna. Most editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late
paper manuscripts: “And both of these   |   shall ever be, / Till the gods to destruction
go.” Bugge ingeniously paraphrases Snorri’s prose: “Vindsval’s father   |   was Vosuth
called, / And rough is all his race.” <i>Vindsval</i>: “the Wind-Cold,” also called Vindljoni, “the Wind-Man.” <i>Svosuth</i>: “the Gentle.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76a">[<a href="#pb76a" class="pginternal">76</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Ymir’s kin</i>: the giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>Bergelmir</i>: when the gods slew Ymir in order to make the world out of his body, so much blood
flowed from him that all the frost-giants were drowned except Bergelmir and his wife,
who escaped in a boat; cf. stanza 35. Of <i>Thruthgelmir</i> (“the Mightily Burning”) we know nothing, but Aurgelmir was the frost-giants’ name
for Ymir himself. Thus Ymir was the first of the giants, and so Othin’s question is
answered.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza, and the last two lines are taken from his version, as
both of the manuscripts omit them. <i>Elivagar</i> (“Stormy Waves”): Mogk suggests that this river may have been the Milky Way. At any
rate, the venom carried in its waters <span class="pageNum" id="pb77a">[<a href="#pb77a" class="pginternal">77</a>]</span>froze into ice-banks over Ginnunga-gap (the “yawning gap” referred to in <i>Voluspo</i>, 3), and then dripped down to make the giant Ymir.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir’s
son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a
son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary,
for various giants had more than the normal number, and Hymir’s mother is credited
with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 8. Of the career of Ymir’s six-headed son we know nothing; he may have been the
Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb78a">[<a href="#pb78a" class="pginternal">78</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Bergelmir</i>: on him and his boat cf. stanza 29 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Hræsvelg</i> (“the Corpse-Eater”): on this giant in eagle’s form cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 50, and <i>Skirnismol</i>, 27.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> With this stanza the question-formula changes, and Othin’s questions from this point
on concern more or less directly the great final struggle. Line 4 is presumably spurious.
<i>Njorth</i>: on Njorth and the Wanes, who gave him as a hostage to the gods at the end of their
war, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79a">[<a href="#pb79a" class="pginternal">79</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> In both manuscripts, apparently through the carelessness of some older copyist, stanzas
40 and 41 are run together: “Eleventh answer me well, what men in the home mightily
battle each day? They fell each other, and fare from the fight all healed full soon
to sit.” Luckily Snorri quotes stanza 41 in full, and the translation is from his
version. Stanza 40 should probably run something like this: “Eleventh answer me well,
  |   if thou knowest all / The fate that is fixed for the gods: / What men are they
  |   who in Othin’s home / Each day to fight go forth?”
</p>
<p id="n1.3.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> <i>The heroes</i>: those brought to Valhall by the Valkyries. After the day’s fighting they are healed
of their wounds and all feast together.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80a">[<a href="#pb80a" class="pginternal">80</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> <i>Nine worlds</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 2. <i>Niflhel</i>: “Dark-Hell.”
</p>
<p id="n1.3.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> <i>The mighty winter</i>: Before the final destruction three winters follow one another with no intervening
summers.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Hoddmimir’s wood</i>: probably <span class="pageNum" id="pb81a">[<a href="#pb81a" class="pginternal">81</a>]</span>this is the ash-tree Yggdrasil, which is sometimes referred to as “Mimir’s Tree,”
because Mimir waters it from his well; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27 and note, and <i>Svipdagsmol</i>, 30 and note. Hoddmimir is presumably another name for Mimir. <i>Lif</i> (“Life”) and <i>Lifthrasir</i> (“Sturdy of Life”?): nothing further is known of this pair, from whom the new race
of men is to spring.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> <i>Fenrir</i>: there appears to be a confusion between the wolf Fenrir (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note) and his son, the wolf Skoll, who steals the sun (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 40 and note).
</p>
<p id="n1.3.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. <i>Alfrothul</i> (“the Elf-Beam”): the sun.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82a">[<a href="#pb82a" class="pginternal">82</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.3.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> <i>Mogthrasir</i> (“Desiring Sons”): not mentioned elsewhere in the Eddic poems, or by Snorri. <i>The maidens</i>: apparently Norns, like the “giant-maids” in <i>Voluspo</i>, 8. These Norns, however, are kindly to men.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 52 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> <i>Vithar</i>: a son of Othin, who slays the wolf Fenrir; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 54 and note. <i>Vali</i>: the son whom Othin begot to avenge Baldr’s death; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 33 and note. <i>Mothi</i> (“Wrath”) and <i>Magni</i> (“Might”): the sons of the god Thor, who after his death inherit his famous hammer,
<i>Mjollnir</i>. Concerning this hammer cf. especially <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>Vingnir</i> (“the <span class="pageNum" id="pb83a">[<a href="#pb83a" class="pginternal">83</a>]</span>Hurler”): Thor. Concerning his death cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 56. This stanza is quoted by Snorri.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> <i>The wolf</i>: Fenrir; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 53 and 54.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> <i>His son</i>: Baldr. Bugge changes lines 3–4 to run: “What did Othin speak   |   in the ear of
Baldr, / When to the bale-fire they bore him?” For Baldr’s death cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and note. The question is, of course, unanswerable save by Othin himself, and
so the giant at last recognizes his guest.
</p>
<p id="n1.3.55"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.3.55" class="pginternal">55</a>.</span> <i>Fated</i>: in stanza 19 Vafthruthnir was rash enough to wager his head against his guest’s
on the outcome of the contest of wisdom, so he knows that his defeat means his death.

<p>Like the preceding poem, the <i>Grimnismol</i> is largely <span class="corr" title="Source: encyclopedic" id="xd32e6579">encyclopædic</span> in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing
no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue
form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological
names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name
of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirröth. Bound between two blazing
fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king’s little son, Agnar,
who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he
declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirröth, and the latter
falls on his sword and is killed.
</p>
<p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts
the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded
by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirröth’s death. These prose notes, of
which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the
student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom
we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order
to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth
century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many
of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.
</p>
<p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is
worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly
narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have
been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems
seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence
of ideas. The stories <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85" class="pginternal">85</a>]</span>themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the
sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material
not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early
Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and
in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose “links” between dialogue
stanzas.
</p>
<p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless,
for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the
so-called “popular” epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently
have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts,
for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the <i>Iliad</i>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition
to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount
of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based
by the compiler.
</p>
<p>Interpolations in such a poem as the <i>Grimnismol</i> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from
other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably
it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed,
probably in the first half of the tenth century.</p>

<p id="p1.4.prose">King Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth. Agnar was
ten winters old, and Geirröth eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear
to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of
the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant,
with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the
peasant cared for <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86" class="pginternal">86</a>]</span>Geirröth, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when
the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirröth. They had
a fair wind, and came to their father’s landing-place. Geirröth was forward in the
boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, “Go thou now where evil
may have thee!” The boat drifted out to sea. Geirröth, however, went up to the house,
and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirröth was made king, and became
a renowned man.
</p>
<p>Othin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: “Seest
thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But
Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.” Frigg said: “He
is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come
to him.” Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about
this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth. She bade the king beware
lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this
sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very
great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them
take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called
himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87" class="pginternal">87</a>]</span>he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between
two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King Geirröth had a son ten winters old,
and called Agnar after his father’s brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a
full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented
without cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle
burned on Grimnir’s back. He spake:

and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished,
but Agnar long ruled there as king.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#p1.4.prose" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The texts of the two manuscripts differ in many minor details. <i>Hrauthung</i>: this mythical king is not mentioned elsewhere. <i>Geirröth</i>: the manuscripts spell his name in various ways<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd32e7326">.</span> <span class="pageNum" id="pb86a">[<a href="#pb86a" class="pginternal">86</a>]</span><i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife. She and Othin nearly always disagreed in some such way as the one
outlined in this story. <i>Hlithskjolf</i> (“Gate-Shelf”): Othin’s watch-tower in heaven, whence he can overlook all the nine
worlds; cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose. <i>Grimnir</i>: “the Hooded One.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb87a">[<a href="#pb87a" class="pginternal">87</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> In the original lines 2 and 4 are both too long for the meter, and thus the true
form of the stanza is doubtful. For line 4 both manuscripts have “the land of the
Goths” instead of simply “the Goths.” The word “Goths” apparently was applied indiscriminately
to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths,
and thus here has no specific application; cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 35 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb88a">[<a href="#pb88a" class="pginternal">88</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Veratyr</i> (“Lord of Men”): Othin. The “gift” which Agnar receives is Othin’s mythological lore.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Thruthheim</i> (“the Place of Might”): the place where Thor, the strongest of the gods, has his
hall, Bilskirnir, described in stanza 24.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Ydalir</i> (“Yew-Dales”): the home of Ull, the archer among the gods, a son of Thor’s wife,
Sif, by another marriage. The wood of the yew-tree was used for bows in the North
just as it was long afterwards in England. <i>Alfheim</i>: the home of the elves. <i>Freyr</i>: cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note. <i>Tooth-gift</i>: the custom of making a present to a child when it cuts its first tooth is, according
to Vigfusson, still in vogue in Iceland.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Valaskjolf</i> (“the Shelf of the Slain”): Othin’s home, in which is his watch-tower, Hlithskjolf.
Gering identifies this with Valhall, and as that is mentioned in stanza 8, he believes
stanza 6 to be an interpolation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89a">[<a href="#pb89a" class="pginternal">89</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Sökkvabekk</i> (“the Sinking Stream”): of this spot and of Saga, who is said to live there, little
is known. Saga may be an hypostasis of Frigg, but Snorri calls her a distinct goddess,
and the name suggests some relation to history or story-telling.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Glathsheim</i> (“the Place of Joy”): Othin’s home, the greatest and most beautiful hall in the world.
<i>Valhall</i> (“Hall of the Slain”): cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31 and note. Valhall is not only the hall whither the slain heroes are brought by
the Valkyries, but also a favorite home of Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> The opening formula is abbreviated in both manuscripts. <i>A wolf</i>: probably the wolf and the eagle were carved figures above the door.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb90a">[<a href="#pb90a" class="pginternal">90</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> <i>Thrymheim</i> (“the Home of Clamor”): on this mountain the giant Thjazi built his home. The god,
or rather Wane, Njorth (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21, note) married Thjazi’s daughter, Skathi. She wished to live in her father’s
hall among the mountains, while Njorth loved his home, Noatun, by the sea. They agreed
to compromise by spending nine nights at Thrymheim and then three at Noatun, but neither
could endure the surroundings of the other’s home, so Skathi returned to Thrymheim,
while Njorth stayed at Noatun. Snorri quotes stanzas 11–15.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>Breithablik</i> (“Wide-Shining”): the house in heaven, free from everything unclean, in which Baldr
(cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32, note), the fairest and best of the gods, lived.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Himinbjorg</i> (“Heaven’s Cliffs”): the dwelling at the end of the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow),
where Heimdall (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27) keeps watch against the coming of the giants. In this stanza the two functions
of Heimdall—as father of mankind (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 1 and note, and <i>Rigsthula</i>, introductory prose and note) and as warder of the gods—seem both to be mentioned,
but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions
is more or less conjectural.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Folkvang</i> (“Field of the Folk”): here is situated Freyja’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb91a">[<a href="#pb91a" class="pginternal">91</a>]</span>hall, Sessrymnir (“Rich in Seats”). Freyja, the sister of Freyr, is the fairest of
the goddesses, and the most kindly disposed to mankind, especially to lovers. <i>Half of the dead</i>: Mogk has made it clear that Freyja represents a confusion between two originally
distinct divinities: the wife of Othin (Frigg) and the northern goddess of love. This
passage appears to have in mind her attributes as Othin’s wife. Snorri has this same
confusion, but there is no reason why the Freyja who was Freyr’s sister should share
the slain with Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> <i>Glitnir</i> (“the Shining”): the home of Forseti, a god of whom we know nothing beyond what Snorri
tells us: “Forseti is the son of Baldr and Nanna, daughter of Nep. All those who come
to him with hard cases to settle go away satisfied; he is the best judge among gods
and men.”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Noatun</i> (“Ships’-Haven”): the home of Njorth, who calms the waves; cf. stanza 11 and <i>Voluspo</i>, 21.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Vithi</i>: this land is not mentioned elsewhere. <i>Vithar</i> avenged his father, Othin, by slaying the wolf Fenrir.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92a">[<a href="#pb92a" class="pginternal">92</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> Stanzas 18–20 appear also in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>. Very possibly they are an interpolation here. <i>Eldhrimnir</i> (“Sooty with Fire”): the great kettle in Valhall, wherein the gods’ cook, <i>Andhrimnir</i> (“The Sooty-Faced”) daily cooks the flesh of the boar <i>Sæhrimnir</i> (“The Blackened”). His flesh suffices for all the heroes there gathered, and each
evening he becomes whole again, to be cooked the next morning.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Freki</i> (“The Greedy”) and <i>Geri</i> (“The Ravenous”): the two wolves who sit by Othin’s side at the feast, and to whom
he gives all the food set before him, since wine is food and drink alike for him.
<i>Heerfather</i>: Othin.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> <i>Mithgarth</i> (“The Middle Home”): the earth. <i>Hugin</i> (“Thought”) and <i>Munin</i> (“Memory”): the two ravens who sit on Othin’s shoulders, and fly forth daily to bring
him news of the world.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb93a">[<a href="#pb93a" class="pginternal">93</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Thund</i> (“The Swollen” or “The Roaring”): the river surrounding Valhall. <i>Thjothvitnir’s fish</i>: presumably the sun, which was caught by the wolf Skoll (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 40), Thjothvitnir meaning “the mighty wolf.” Such a phrase, characteristic of all
Skaldic poetry, is rather rare in the <i>Edda</i>. The last two lines refer to the attack on Valhall by the people of Hel; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 51.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Valgrind</i> (“The Death-Gate”): the outer gate of Valhall; cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 68 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> This and the following stanza stand in reversed order in <i>Regius</i>. Snorri quotes stanza 23 as a proof of the vast size of Valhall. The last two lines
refer to the final battle with Fenrir and the other enemies.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, brought in through a confusion
of the first two lines with those of stanza 23. Its description of Thor’s house, Bilskirnir
(cf. stanza 4 and <span class="pageNum" id="pb94a">[<a href="#pb94a" class="pginternal">94</a>]</span>note) has nothing to do with that of Valhall. Snorri quotes the stanza in his account
of Thor.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> The first line in the original is, as indicated in the translation, too long, and
various attempts to amend it have been made. <i>Heithrun</i>: the she-goat who lives on the twigs of the tree <i>Lærath</i> (presumably the ash Yggdrasil), and daily gives mead which, like the boar’s flesh,
suffices for all the heroes in Valhall. In Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> Gangleri foolishly asks whether the heroes drink water, whereto Har replies, “Do
you imagine that Othin invites kings and earls and other noble men, and then gives
them water to drink?”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Eikthyrnir</i> (“The Oak-Thorned,” i.e., with antlers, “thorns,” like an oak): this animal presumably
represents the clouds. The first line, like that of stanza 25, is too long in the
original. <i>Lærath</i>: cf. stanza 25, note. <i>Hvergelmir</i>: according to Snorri, this spring, “the Cauldron-Roaring,” was in the midst of Niflheim,
the world of darkness and the dead, beneath the third root of the ash Yggdrasil. Snorri
gives a list of the rivers flowing thence nearly identical with the one in the poem.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb95a">[<a href="#pb95a" class="pginternal">95</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> The entire passage from stanza 27 through stanza 35 is confused. The whole thing
may well be an interpolation. Bugge calls stanzas 27–30 an interpolation, and editors
who have accepted the passage as a whole have rejected various lines. The spelling
of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless
here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting
similar problems, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 10–16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27–28 in his prose, though not consecutively.
The name <i>Rin</i>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in
the hero poems, but the similarity is doubtless purely accidental.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Slith</i> may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in <i>Voluspo</i>, 36, as flowing through the giants’ land. <i>Leipt</i>: in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> II, 29, this river is mentioned as one by which a solemn oath is sworn, and Gering
points the parallel to the significance of the Styx among the Greeks. The other rivers
here named are not mentioned elsewhere in the poems.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96a">[<a href="#pb96a" class="pginternal">96</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding
it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three
springs beneath them. “The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this
root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth’s well.” (Cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 19) “There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over
Bifrost, which is also called the Gods’ Bridge.” Thor has to go on foot in the last
days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however,
is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge
becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza.
Lines 3–4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> This stanza, again possibly an interpolation, is closely paraphrased by Snorri following
the passage quoted in the previous note. <i>Glath</i> (“Joyous”): identified in the <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> with Skinfaxi, the horse of day; cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 12. <i>Gyllir</i>: “Golden.” <i>Gler</i>: “Shining.” <i>Skeithbrimir</i>: “Swift-Going.” <i>Silfrintopp</i>: “Silver-Topped.” <i>Sinir</i>: “Sinewy.” <i>Gisl</i>: the meaning is doubtful; Gering suggests “Gleaming.” <i>Falhofnir</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb97a">[<a href="#pb97a" class="pginternal">97</a>]</span>“Hollow-Hoofed.” <i>Golltopp</i> (“Gold-Topped”): this horse belonged to Heimdall (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 1 and 46). It is noteworthy that gold was one of the attributes of Heimdall’s belongings,
and, because his teeth were of gold, he was also called Gullintanni (“Gold-Toothed”).
<i>Lettfeti</i>: “Light-Feet.” Othin’s eight-footed horse, Sleipnir, is not mentioned in this list.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza
29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this
stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of
Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> thus: “An eagle sits in the branches of the ash-tree, and he is very wise; and between
his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Ratatosk</i> (“The Swift-Tusked”): concerning this squirrel, the <i>Prose Edda</i> has to add only that he runs up and down the tree conveying the abusive language
of the eagle (see note on stanza 31) and the dragon <i>Nithhogg</i> (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note) to each other. The hypothesis that Ratatosk “represents the undying
hatred between the sustaining and the destroying elements—the gods and the giants,”
seems a trifle far-fetched.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Stanzas 33–34 may well be interpolated, and are certainly in bad shape in the Mss.
Bugge points out that they are probably of later origin than those surrounding them.
Snorri <span class="pageNum" id="pb98a">[<a href="#pb98a" class="pginternal">98</a>]</span>closely paraphrases stanza 33, but without elaboration, and nothing further is known
of the <i>four harts</i>. It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart
mentioned in stanza 26, just as the list of dragons in stanza 34 seems to have been
expanded out of Nithhogg, the only authentic dragon under the root of the ash. <i>Highest twigs</i>: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling. Something has apparently been lost from lines
3–4, but there is no clue as to its nature.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> Cf. note on previous stanza. Nothing further is known of any of the serpents here
listed, and the meanings of many of the names are conjectural. Snorri quotes this
stanza. Editors have altered it in various ways in an attempt to regularize the meter.
<i>Goin</i> and <i>Moin</i>: meaning obscure. <i>Grafvitnir</i>: “The Gnawing Wolf.” <i>Grabak</i>: “Gray-Back.” <i>Grafvolluth</i>: “The Field-Gnawer.” <i>Ofnir</i> and <i>Svafnir</i> (“The Bewilderer” and “The Sleep-Bringer”): it is noteworthy that in stanza 54 Othin
gives himself these two names.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza, which concludes the passage, beginning with stanza 25,
describing Yggdrasil. If we assume that stanzas 27–34 are later interpolations—possibly
excepting 32—this section of the poem reads clearly enough.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99a">[<a href="#pb99a" class="pginternal">99</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this list of the Valkyries, concerning whom cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31 and note, where a different list of names is given. <i>Hrist</i>: “Shaker.” <i>Mist</i>: “Mist.” <i>Skeggjold</i>: “Ax-Time.” <i>Skogul</i>: “Raging” (?). <i>Hild</i>: “Warrior.” <i>Thruth</i>: “Might.” <i><span class="corr" title="Source: Hlok" id="xd32e7755">Hlokk</span></i>: “Shrieking.” <i>Herfjotur</i>: “Host-Fetter.” <i>Gol</i>: “Screaming.” <i>Geironul</i>: “Spear-Bearer.” <i>Randgrith</i>: “Shield-Bearer.” <i>Rathgrith</i>: Gering guesses “Plan-Destroyer.” <i>Reginleif</i>: “Gods’-Kin.” Manuscripts and editions vary greatly in the spelling of these names,
and hence in their significance.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Müllenhoff suspects stanzas 37–41 to have been interpolated, and Edzardi thinks they
may have come from the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. Snorri closely paraphrases stanzas 37–39, and quotes 40–41. <i>Arvak</i> (“Early Waker”) and <i>Alsvith</i> (“All-Swift”): the horses of the sun, named also in <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 15. According to Snorri: “There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children;
they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The
gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven;
and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun <span class="pageNum" id="pb100a">[<a href="#pb100a" class="pginternal">100</a>]</span>which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim.
The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows
to cool them, and in some songs these are called ‘the cold iron.’ ”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> <i>Svalin</i> (“The Cooling”): the only other reference to this shield is in <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 15.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Skoll</i> and <i>Hati</i>: the wolves that devour respectively the sun and moon. The latter is the son of Hrothvitnir
(“The Mighty Wolf,” i.e. Fenrir); cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 40, and <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 46–47, in which Fenrir appears as the thief. <i>Ironwood</i>: a conjectural emendation of an obscure phrase; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 40.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri. They seem to have come from a
different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of
the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. This stanza is closely parallel to <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 21, which see, as also <i>Voluspo</i>, 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made
out of Ymir’s teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall
made out of Ymir’s eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the
giants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb101a">[<a href="#pb101a" class="pginternal">101</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between
two fires. He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull
aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke-vent
in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On <i>Ull</i>, the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better
reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to
do with the context, and stanza 45 continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun
in stanza 42. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. <i>Ivaldi</i> (“The Mighty”): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not
only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin’s spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for
Thor’s wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. <i>Skithblathnir</i>: this ship (“Wooden-Bladed”) always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it
could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. <i>Freyr</i>: concerning him and his father, see <i>Voluspo</i>, 21, note, and <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb102a">[<a href="#pb102a" class="pginternal">102</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was
probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier.
It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,—“Brimir
of swords.” <i>Yggdrasil</i>: cf. stanzas 25–35. <i>Skithblathnir</i>: cf. stanza 43, note. <i>Sleipnir</i>: Othin’s eight-legged horse, one of Loki’s numerous progeny, borne by him to the
stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for
the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari’s aid, as to make the
gods fear he would win his promised reward—Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the
work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant
failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. <i>Bilrost</i>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza),
on which cf. stanza 29. <i>Bragi</i>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned
only three times in the poems of the <i>Edda</i>. In Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps
the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally
apotheosized as early as the tenth century. <i>Hobrok</i>: nothing further is known of him. <i>Garm</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 44.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> With this stanza the narrative current of the poem is resumed. <i>Ægir</i>: the sea-god; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, introductory prose.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103a">[<a href="#pb103a" class="pginternal">103</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> Concerning the condition of stanzas 46–50, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can
be said. Lines and entire stanzas of this “catalogue” sort undoubtedly came and went
with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission. Many of the names
are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork. As in
nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily
almost limitless. <i>Grim</i>: “The Hooded.” <i>Gangleri</i>: “The Wanderer.” <i>Herjan</i>: “The Ruler.” <i>Hjalmberi</i>: “The Helmet-Bearer.” <i>Thekk</i>: “The Much-Loved.” <i>Thrithi</i>: “The Third” (in Snorri’s <i>Edda</i> the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being
Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi. Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been
the source of endless debate. Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat
muddled influence of early Christianity.) <i>Thuth</i> and <i>Uth</i>: both names defy guesswork. <i>Helblindi</i>: “Hel-Blinder” (two manuscripts have Herblindi—“Host-Blinder”). <i>Hor</i>: “The High One.”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> <i>Sath</i>: “The Truthful.” <i>Svipal</i>: “The Changing.” <i>Sanngetal</i>: “The Truth-Teller.” <i>Herteit</i>: “Glad of the Host.” <i>Hnikar</i>: “The Overthrower.” <i>Bileyg</i>: “The Shifty-Eyed.” <i>Baleyg</i>: “The Flaming-Eyed.” <i>Bolverk</i>: “Doer of Ill” (cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 104 and note). <i>Fjolnir</i>: “The Many-Shaped.” <i>Grimnir</i>: “The Hooded.” <i>Glapsvith</i>: “Swift in Deceit.” <i>Fjolsvith</i>: “Wide of Wisdom.”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> <i>Sithhott</i>: “With Broad Hat.” <i>Sithskegg</i>: “Long-Bearded.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb104a">[<a href="#pb104a" class="pginternal">104</a>]</span><i>Sigfather</i>: “Father of Victory.” <i>Hnikuth</i>: “Overthrower.” <i>Valfather</i>: “Father of the Slain.” <i>Atrith</i>: “The Rider.” <i>Farmatyr</i>: “Helper of Cargoes” (i.e., god of sailors).
</p>
<p id="n1.4.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> Nothing is known of Asmund, of Othin’s appearance as Jalk, or of the occasion when
he “went in a sledge” as Kjalar (“Ruler of Keels”?). <i>Thror</i> and <i>Vithur</i> are also of uncertain meaning. <i>Oski</i>: “God of Wishes.” <i>Biflindi</i>: the manuscripts vary widely in the form of this name. <i>Jafnhor</i>: “Equally High” (cf. note on stanza 46). <i>Omi</i>: “The Shouter.” <i>Gondlir</i>: “Wand-Bearer.” <i>Harbarth</i>: “Graybeard” (cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, introduction).
</p>
<p id="n1.4.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> Nothing further is known of the episode here mentioned. Sokkmimir is presumably Mithvitnir’s
son. Snorri quotes the names Svithur and Svithrir, but omits all the remainder of
the stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105a">[<a href="#pb105a" class="pginternal">105</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.4.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> Again the poem returns to the direct action, Othin addressing the terrified Geirröth.
The manuscripts show no lacuna. Some editors supply a second line from paper manuscripts:
“Greatly by me art beguiled.”
</p>
<p id="n1.4.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> <i>Ygg</i>: Othin (“The Terrible”). <i>The maids</i>: the three Norns.
</p>
<p id="n1.4.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.4.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> Possibly out of place, and probably more or less corrupt. <i>Thund</i>: “The Thunderer.” <i>Vak</i>: “The Wakeful.” <i>Skilfing</i>: “The Shaker.” <i>Vofuth</i>: “The Wanderer.” <i>Hroptatyr</i>: “Crier of the Gods.” <i>Gaut</i>: “Father.” <i>Ofnir</i> and <i>Svafnir</i>: cf. stanza 34.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Skirnismol</i> is found complete in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, and through stanza 27 in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>. Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In <i>Regius</i> the poem is entitled “For Scirnis” (“Skirnir’s Journey”).
</p>
<p>The <i>Skirnismol</i> differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality.
As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being
supplied in the prose “links,” concerning which cf. introductory note to the <i>Grimnismol</i>. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect
it with the <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man.
Bugge’s guess that the <i>Skirnismol</i> was the work of the author of the <i>Lokasenna</i> is also possible, though it has less to support it.
</p>
<p>Critics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the
first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as 900, and claims
it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another,
before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza
31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have
traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western
origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson’s reiterated “<span lang="no">Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk</span>” is somewhat exasperating. Wherever the <i>Skirnismol</i> was composed, it has been preserved in exceptionally good condition, and seems to
be practically devoid of interpolations or lacunæ.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#p1.5.prose" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Freyr</i>: concerning his father, Njorth, and the race of the Wanes in general, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note. Snorri thus describes Njorth’s family: “Njorth begat two children in
Noatun; the son was named Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of aspect
and mighty. Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and
therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and
welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses.
When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When
she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please
her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.” <i>Hlithskjolf</i>: Othin’s watch-tower; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, introductory prose. <i>He said</i>: both manuscripts have “Then Skathi said:” (Skathi was Njorth’s wife), but Bugge’s
emendation, based on Snorri’s version, is doubtless correct.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>My son</i>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have “our son,” which, of course, goes with
the introduction of Skathi in the prose. As the stanza is clearly addressed to Skirnir,
the change of pronouns seems justified. The same confusion occurs in stanza 2, where
Skirnir in the manuscripts is made to speak of Freyr as <span class="pageNum" id="pb109a">[<a href="#pb109a" class="pginternal">109</a>]</span>“your son” (plural). The plural pronoun in the original involves a metrical error,
which is corrected by the emendation.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Elfbeam</i>: the sun, so called because its rays were fatal to elves and dwarfs; cf. <i>Alvissmol</i>, 35.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Gymir</i>: a mountain-giant, husband of Aurbotha, and father of Gerth, fairest among women.
This is all Snorri tells of him in his paraphrase of the story.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Snorri’s paraphrase of the poem is sufficiently close so that his addition of another
sentence to Freyr’s speech makes it probable <span class="pageNum" id="pb110a">[<a href="#pb110a" class="pginternal">110</a>]</span>that a stanza has dropped out between 7 and 8. This has been tentatively reconstructed,
thus: “Hither to me   |   shalt thou bring the maid, / And home shalt thou lead her
here, / If her father wills it   |   or wills it not, / And good reward shalt thou
get.” Finn Magnusen detected the probable omission of a stanza here as early as 1821.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>The sword</i>: Freyr’s gift of his sword to Skirnir eventually proves fatal, for at the last battle,
when Freyr is attacked by Beli, whom he kills bare-handed, and later when the fire-demon,
Surt, slays him in turn, he is weaponless; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 53 and note. <i>Against the giants grim</i>: the condition of this line makes it seem like an error in copying, and it is possible
that it should be identical with the fourth line of the next stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb111a">[<a href="#pb111a" class="pginternal">111</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Some editors reject line 3 as spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Line 2 is in neither manuscript, and no gap is indicated. I have followed Grundtvig’s
conjectural emendation.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> This stanza is almost exactly like many in the first part of <span class="pageNum" id="pb112a">[<a href="#pb112a" class="pginternal">112</a>]</span>the <i>Hovamol</i>, and may well have been a separate proverb. After this stanza the scene shifts to
the interior of the house.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> No gap indicated in either manuscript. Bugge and Niedner have attempted emendations,
while Hildebrand suggests that the last two lines of stanza 14 are spurious, 14, 1–2,
and 15 thus forming a single stanza, which seems doubtful.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Brother’s slayer</i>: perhaps the brother is Beli, slain by Freyr; the only other references are in <i>Voluspo</i>, 53, and in Snorri’s paraphrase of the <i>Skirnismol</i>, which merely says that Freyr’s gift of his sword to Skirnir “was the reason why
he was weaponless when he met Beli, and he killed him bare-handed.” Skirnir himself
seems never to have killed anybody.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113a">[<a href="#pb113a" class="pginternal">113</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Wise Wanes</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> The <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> omits this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Apples</i>: the apple was the symbol of fruitfulness, and also of eternal youth. According to
Snorri, the goddess Ithun had charge of the apples which the gods ate whenever they
felt themselves growing old.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb114a">[<a href="#pb114a" class="pginternal">114</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Ring</i>: the ring Draupnir (“Dropper”) was made by the dwarfs for Othin, who laid it on Baldr’s
pyre when the latter’s corpse was burned (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and note, and <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>). Baldr, however, sent the ring back to Othin from hell. How Freyr obtained it is
nowhere stated. Andvari’s ring (Andvaranaut) had a similar power of creating gold;
cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose <span class="pageNum" id="pb115a">[<a href="#pb115a" class="pginternal">115</a>]</span>after stanza 4 and note. Lines 3 and 4 of this stanza, and the first two of stanza
22, are missing in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> The first two lines are abbreviated in both manuscripts.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> With this stanza, bribes and threats having failed, Skirnir begins a curse which,
by the power of his magic staff, is to fall on Gerth if she refuses Freyr.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> <i>Eagle’s hill</i>: the hill at the end of heaven, and consequently overlooking hell, where the giant
Hræsvelg sits “in an eagle’s guise,” and makes the winds with his wings; cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 37, also <i>Voluspo</i>, 50. The second line is faulty in both manuscripts; Hildebrand’s emendation corrects
the error, but omits an effective touch; the manuscript line may be rendered “And
look and hanker for hell.” The <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> breaks off with the fourth line of this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Hrimnir</i>: a frost-giant, mentioned elsewhere only in <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 33. Line 3 is probably spurious. <i>Watchman of the gods</i>: Heimdall; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 46.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb116a">[<a href="#pb116a" class="pginternal">116</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> Three nouns of doubtful meaning, which I have rendered <i>rage</i>, <i>longing</i>, and <i>heart</i> respectively, make the precise force of this stanza obscure. Niedner and Sijmons
mark the entire stanza as interpolated, and Jonsson rejects line 5.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> In <i>Regius</i> and in nearly all the editions the first two lines of this stanza are followed by
lines 3–5 of stanza 35. I have followed Niedner, Sijmons, and Gering. The two words
here translated <i>vile things</i> are obscure; Gering renders the phrase simply “Kobolde.”
</p>
<p id="n1.5.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> The confusion noted as to the preceding stanza, and a metrical error in the third
line, have led to various rearrangements and emendations; line 3 certainly looks like
an interpolation. <i>Three-headed giants</i>: concerning giants with numerous heads, cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 33, and <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 8.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117a">[<a href="#pb117a" class="pginternal">117</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; Niedner makes the line here given as 4 the first
half of line 3, and fills out the stanza thus: “with which I will tame you, / Maid,
to work my will.” The whole stanza seems to be either interpolated or out of place;
it would fit better after stanza 25.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Jonsson marks this stanza as interpolated. The word translated <i>most evil</i> is another case of guesswork.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> Most editors reject line 3 as spurious, and some also reject line 6. Lines 2 and
3 may have been expanded out of a single line running approximately “Ye gods and Suttung’s
sons.” <i>Suttung</i>: concerning this giant cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 104 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb118a">[<a href="#pb118a" class="pginternal">118</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.5.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Most editors combine lines 1–2 with stanza 36 (either with the first two lines thereof
or the whole stanza), as lines 3–5 stand in the manuscript after line 2 of stanza
30. <i>Hrimgrimnir</i> (“The Frost-Shrouded”): a giant not elsewhere mentioned. Line 5, as a repetition
of line 4, is probably a later addition.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> For the combination of this stanza with the preceding one, cf. note on stanza 35.
The scribe clearly did not consider that the stanza began with line 1, as the first
word thereof in the manuscript does not begin with a capital letter and has no period
before it. The first word of line 3, however, is so marked. Line 5 may well be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Again the scribe seems to have been uncertain as to the stanza divisions. This time
the first line is preceded by a period, but begins with a small letter. Many editors
have made line 2 <span class="pageNum" id="pb119a">[<a href="#pb119a" class="pginternal">119</a>]</span>into two half-lines. <i>A charm</i>: literally, the rune Thurs (þ); the runic letters all had magic attributes; cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 6–7 and notes.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> <i>Barri</i>: “The Leafy.”

<p id="n1.5.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Abbreviated to initial letters in the manuscript.
</p>
<p id="n1.5.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.5.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The superscription is lacking in <i>Regius</i>. Snorri quotes this one stanza in his prose paraphrase, <i>Gylfaginning</i>, chapter 37. The two versions are substantially the same, except that Snorri makes
the first line read, “Long is one night,   |   long is the second.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Harbarthsljoth</i> is found complete in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, where it follows the <i>Skirnismol</i>, and from the fourth line of <span class="corr" title="Source: stan a" id="xd32e9050">stanza</span> 19 to the end of the poem in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, of which it occupies the first page and a half.
</p>
<p>The poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of
all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an
example is given). The name of this verse-form means “in the manner of conversation,”
and the <i>Harbarthsljoth’s</i> verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of
Malahattr, but in the <i>Harbarthsljoth</i> the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently
employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into
any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.
</p>
<p>How far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original
poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem,
but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is
quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk’s theory that the
author was “a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,” and have translated the poem
as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original
by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm
of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original
Norse.
</p>
<p>The poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted
in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise
of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations
and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly
of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the
life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex
symbolism into it, particularly by representing <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122" class="pginternal">122</a>]</span>it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor).
But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.
</p>
<p>Verse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed
articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present
form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and
its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.
</p>
<p>Owing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators
have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all
the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose1.6" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Harbarth</i> (“Gray-Beard”): Othin. On the nature of the prose notes found in the manuscripts,
cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, introduction. <i>Thor</i>: the journeys of the thunder-god were almost as numerous as those of Othin; cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i> and <i>Hymiskvitha</i>. Like the Robin Hood of the British ballads, Thor was often temporarily worsted,
but always managed to come out ahead in the end. His “Journey in the East” is presumably
the famous episode, related in full by Snorri, in the course of which he encountered
the giant Skrymir, and in the house of Utgartha-Loki lifted the cat which turned out
to be Mithgarthsorm. The <i>Hymiskvitha</i> relates a further incident of this journey.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123a">[<a href="#pb123a" class="pginternal">123</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> The superscriptions to the speeches are badly confused in the manuscripts, but editors
have agreed fairly well as to where they belong.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> From the fact that in <i>Regius</i> line 3 begins with a capital letter, it is possible that lines 3–4 constitute the
ferryman’s reply, with something lost before stanza 4.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Thy mother</i>: Jorth (Earth).
</p>
<p id="n1.6.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Some editors assume a lacuna after this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Three good dwellings</i>: this has been generally assumed to mean three separate establishments, but it may
refer simply to <span class="pageNum" id="pb124a">[<a href="#pb124a" class="pginternal">124</a>]</span>the three parts of a single farm, the dwelling proper, the cattle-barn and the storehouse;
i.e., Thor is not even a respectable peasant.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Hildolf</i> (“slaughtering wolf”): not elsewhere mentioned in the <i>Edda</i>. <i>Rathsey</i> (“Isle of Counsel”): likewise not mentioned elsewhere.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>In danger</i>: Thor is “sekr,” i.e., without the protection of any law, so long as he is in the
territory of his enemies, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb125a">[<a href="#pb125a" class="pginternal">125</a>]</span>giants. <i>Meili</i>: a practically unknown son of Othin, mentioned here only in the <i>Edda</i>. <i>Magni</i>: son of Thor and the giantess Jarnsaxa; after Thor’s fight with Hrungnir (cf. stanza
14, note) Magni, though but three days old, was the only one of the gods strong enough
to lift the dead giant’s foot from Thor’s neck. After rescuing his father, Magni said
to him: “There would have been little trouble, father, had I but come sooner; I think
I should have sent this giant to hell with my fist if I had met him first.” Magni
and his brother, Mothi, inherit Thor’s hammer.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> This stanza is hopelessly confused as to form, but none of the editorial rearrangements
have materially altered the meaning. <i>Doomed to die</i>: the word “feigr” occurs constantly in the Old Norse poems and sagas; the idea of
an inevitable but unknown fate seems to have been practically universal throughout
the pre-Christian period. On the concealment of names from enemies, cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, prose after stanza 1.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126a">[<a href="#pb126a" class="pginternal">126</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> This stanza, like the preceding one, is peculiarly chaotic in the manuscript, and
has been variously emended.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Hrungnir</i>: this giant rashly wagered his head that his horse, Gullfaxi, was swifter than Othin’s
Sleipnir. In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the
home of the gods, where he became very drunk. Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge
to a duel. Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant
nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of
stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone.
But Thjalfi, Thor’s servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground,
wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it. The hammer Mjollnir shattered
both the grindstone and Hrungnir’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb127a">[<a href="#pb127a" class="pginternal">127</a>]</span>head, but part of the grindstone knocked Thor down, and the giant fell with his foot
on Thor’s neck (cf. note on stanza 9). Meanwhile Thjalfi dispatched the dummy giant
without trouble.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Fjolvar</i>: not elsewhere mentioned in the poems; perhaps the father of the “seven sisters”
referred to in stanza 18. <i>Algrön</i> “The All-Green”: not mentioned elsewhere in the <i>Edda</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> Thor is always eager for stories of this sort; cf. stanzas 31 and 33.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> Lines 1–2 are obscure, but apparently Harbarth means that the women were wise to
give in to him cheerfully, resistance to his power being as impossible as (lines 3–4)
making ropes of sand or digging the bottoms out of the valleys. Nothing further is
known of these unlucky “seven sisters.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb128a">[<a href="#pb128a" class="pginternal">128</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Thjazi</i>: this giant, by a trick, secured possession of the goddess Ithun and her apples (cf.
<i>Skirnismol</i>, 19, note), and carried her off into Jotunheim. Loki, through whose fault she had
been betrayed, was sent after her by the gods. He went in Freyja’s “hawk’s-dress”
(cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 3), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her. Thjazi, in the shape of an
eagle, gave chase. But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle’s wings, and
then they killed him. Snorri’s prose version does not attribute this feat particularly
to Thor. Thjazi’s daughter was Skathi, whom the gods permitted to marry Njorth as
a recompense for her father’s death. <i>Alvaldi</i>: of him we know only that he was the father of Thjazi, Ithi and Gang, who divided
his wealth, each taking a mouthful of gold. The name is variously spelled. It is not
known which stars were called “Thjazi’s Eyes.” In the middle of line 4 begins the
fragmentary version of the poem found in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> <i>Riders by night</i>: witches, who were supposed to ride on wolves in the dark. Nothing further is known
of this adventure.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb129a">[<a href="#pb129a" class="pginternal">129</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>The oak, etc</i>.: this proverb is found elsewhere (e.g., <i>Grettissaga</i>) in approximately the same words. Its force is much like our “to the victor belong
the spoils.”
</p>
<p id="n1.6.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Thor killed no women of the giants’ race on the “journey to the East” so fully described
by Snorri, his great giant-killing adventure being the one narrated in the <i>Thrymskvitha</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Valland</i>: this mythical place (“Land of Slaughter”) is elsewhere mentioned, but not further
<span class="corr" title="Source: characterised" id="xd32e9982">characterized</span>; cf. prose introduction to <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, and <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, 2. On the bringing of slain heroes to Othin, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31 and note, <span class="pageNum" id="pb130a">[<a href="#pb130a" class="pginternal">130</a>]</span>and, for a somewhat different version, <i>Grimnismol</i>, 14. Nowhere else is it indicated that Thor has an asylum for dead peasants.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor’s eastward journey.
He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night.
Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller
room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the
earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir’s lying down near them, and the
noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the
smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is
in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in <i>Hovamol</i>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went. Loki
taunts Thor with this adventure in <i>Lokasenna</i>, 60 and 62, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from <i>Lokasenna</i>, 60, 4.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131a">[<a href="#pb131a" class="pginternal">131</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>The river</i>: probably Ifing, which flows between the land of the gods and that of the giants;
cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 16. <i>Sons of Svarang</i>: presumably the giants; Svarang is not elsewhere mentioned in the poems, nor is there
any other account of Thor’s defense of the passage.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Othin’s adventures of this sort were too numerous to make it possible to identify
this particular person. <i>By stealth</i>: so the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>; <i>Regius</i>, followed by several editors, has “long meeting with her.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb132a">[<a href="#pb132a" class="pginternal">132</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> <i>Heel-biter</i>: this effective parallel to our “back-biter” is not found elsewhere in Old Norse.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> <i>Hlesey</i>: “the Island of the Sea-God” (Hler = Ægir), identified with the Danish island Läsö,
in the Kattegat. It appears again, much out of place, in <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 28. <i>Berserkers</i>: originally men who could turn themselves into bears, hence the name, “bear-shirts”;
cf. the werewolf or loupgarou. Later the name was applied to men who at times became
seized with a madness for bloodshed; cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 23 and note. The women here mentioned are obviously of the earlier type.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb133a">[<a href="#pb133a" class="pginternal">133</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Thjalfi</i>: Thor’s servant; cf. note on stanza 14.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> To what expedition this refers is unknown, but apparently Othin speaks of himself
as allied to the foes of the gods.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> <i>Hatred</i>: so <i>Regius</i>; the other manuscript has, apparently, “sickness.”
</p>
<p id="n1.6.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Just what Othin means, or why his words should so have enraged Thor, is not evident,
though he may imply that Thor is open to bribery. Perhaps a passage has dropped out
before stanza 43.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb134a">[<a href="#pb134a" class="pginternal">134</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.6.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Othin refers to the dead, from whom he seeks information through his magic power.
</p>
<p id="n1.6.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.6.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> <i>Sif</i>: Thor’s wife, the lover being presumably <i>Loki</i>; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 54.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135a">[<a href="#pb135a" class="pginternal">135</a>]</span></p>

<p class="first">The <i>Hymiskvitha</i> is found complete in both manuscripts; in <i>Regius</i> it follows the <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, while in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> it comes after the <i>Grimnismol</i>. Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.
</p>
<p>The poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative
fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance,
have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply
put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new
poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he
took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse,
and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted.
His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy
for wonders.
</p>
<p>The poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though
Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date
it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances
are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather
recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs
to a period of literary decadence,—the great days of Eddic poetry would never have
permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir’s home—and to one in which
the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal
subtleties of skaldic verse.
</p>
<p>While the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary
here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very
considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always
definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by
an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of
its own. It was to explain some of the “kennings” which composed this special <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139" class="pginternal">139</a>]</span>vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the <i>Prose Edda</i>. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the <i>Egilssaga</i>, a sword is called “the halo of the helm,” “the wound-hoe,” “the blood-snake” (possibly;
no one is sure what the compound word means) and “the ice of the girdle,” while men
appear in the same stanza as “Othin’s ash-trees,” and battle is spoken of as “the
iron game.” One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.
</p>
<p>Skaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the
<i>Hymiskvitha</i> these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from
the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories—Thor’s
expedition after Hymir’s kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm—saves
it from complete mediocrity.</p>

<p class="first" id="n1.7.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Twigs</i>: Vigfusson comments at some length on “the rite practised in the heathen age of inquiring
into the future by dipping bunches of chips or twigs into the blood (of sacrifices)
and shaking them.” But the two operations may have been separate, the twigs being
simply “divining-rods” marked with runes. In either case, the gods were seeking information
by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. <i>Ægir</i>: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is
told here and in the introductory prose to the <i>Lokasenna</i>, though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (Läsö, cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 37). <i>Grimnismol</i>, 45, has a reference to this same feast.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140a">[<a href="#pb140a" class="pginternal">140</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Mountain-dweller</i>: the giant (Ægir). <i>Line 2</i>: the principal word in the original has defied interpretation, and any translation
of the line must be largely guesswork. <i>Ygg</i>: Othin; his son is Thor. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Word-wielder</i>: Thor. <i>The giant</i>: Ægir. <i>Sif</i>: Thor’s wife; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 48. <i>The kettle</i>: Ægir’s kettle is possibly the sea itself.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Tyr</i>: the god of battle; his two great achievements were thrusting his hand into the mouth
of the wolf Fenrir so that the gods might bind him, whereby he lost his hand (cf.
<i>Voluspo</i>, 39, note), and his fight with the hound Garm in the last battle, in which they kill
each other. <i>Hlorrithi</i>: Thor.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Elivagar</i> (“Stormy Waves”): possibly the Milky Way; <span class="pageNum" id="pb141a">[<a href="#pb141a" class="pginternal">141</a>]</span>cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 31, note. <i>Hymir</i>: this giant figures only in this episode. It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere
spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in
an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word “father” to
“grandfather,” but this does not help greatly.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as
above. From this point through stanza 11 the editors have varied considerably in grouping
the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8,
9, and 10 as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present
arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after
stanza 6.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Egil</i>: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor’s servant, Thjalfi, for,
according to Snorri, Thor’s first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant
whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note.
The <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i> has “Ægir” instead of “Egil,” but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left Ægir’s
house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>The youth</i>: Tyr, whose extraordinary grandmother is Hymir’s mother. We know nothing further
of her, or of <i>the other</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb142a">[<a href="#pb142a" class="pginternal">142</a>]</span>who is Hymir’s wife and Tyr’s mother. It may be guessed, however, that she belonged
rather to the race of the gods than to that of the giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Two or three editors give this stanza a superscription (“The concubine spake,” “The
daughter spake”). Line 3 is commonly regarded as spurious. <i>The foeman of Hroth</i>: of course this means Thor, but nothing is known of any enemy of his by this name.
Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning “the famous enemy” out of
the phrase. Concerning Thor as the friend of man, particularly of the peasant class,
cf. introduction to <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>. <i>Veur</i>: another name, of uncertain meaning, for Thor.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb143a">[<a href="#pb143a" class="pginternal">143</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Eight</i>: the giant’s glance, besides breaking the beam, knocks down all the kettles with
such violence that all but the one under which Thor and Tyr are hiding are broken.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> Hymir’s wrath does not permit him to ignore the duties of a host to his guests, always
strongly insisted on.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Thor’s appetite figures elsewhere; cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 24.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>The comrade of Hrungnir</i>: Hymir, presumably simply because both are giants; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 14 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb144a">[<a href="#pb144a" class="pginternal">144</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> The manuscripts indicate no lacuna, and many editors unite stanza 17 with lines 1
and 2 of 18. Sijmons and Gering assume a gap after these two lines, but it seems more
probable that the missing passage, if any, belonged before them, supplying the connection
with the previous stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> The manuscripts have no superscription. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with lines
1 and 2 of stanza 19. In Snorri’s extended paraphrase of the story, Hymir declines
to go fishing with Thor on the ground that the latter is too small a person to be
worth bothering about. “You would freeze,” he says, “if you stayed out in mid-ocean
as long as I generally do.” <i>Bait</i> (line 4): the word literally means “chaff,” hence any small bits; Hymir means that
Thor should collect dung for bait.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with stanza 20. <i>Fortress</i>, etc.: the ox’s head; cf. introductory note concerning the diction of this poem.
Several editors assume a lacuna after stanza 19, but this seems unnecessary.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb145a">[<a href="#pb145a" class="pginternal">145</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The manuscripts have no superscription. <i>Steerer of ships</i>: probably merely a reference to Thor’s intention to go fishing. The lacuna after
stanza 20 is assumed by most editors.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Lord of the goats</i>: Thor, because of his goat-drawn chariot. <i>Ape-begotten</i>: Hymir; the word “api,” rare until relatively late times in its literal sense, is
fairly common with the meaning of “fool.” Giants were generally assumed to be stupid.
<i>Steed of the rollers</i>: a ship, because boats were pulled up on shore by means of rollers.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Warder of men</i>: Thor; cf. stanza 11. <i>Worm’s destroyer</i>: likewise Thor, who in the last battle slays, and is slain by, Mithgarthsorm; cf.
<i>Voluspo</i>, 56. <i>The foe of the gods</i>: Mithgarthsorm, who lies in the sea, and surrounds the whole earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb146a">[<a href="#pb146a" class="pginternal">146</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Hill of the hair</i>: head,—a thoroughly characteristic skaldic phrase. <i>Brother of Fenrir</i>: Mithgarthsorm was, like the wolf Fenrir and the goddess Hel, born to Loki and the
giantess Angrbotha (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note), and I have translated this line accordingly; but the word used in
the text has been guessed as meaning almost anything from “comrade” to “enemy.”
</p>
<p id="n1.7.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but that a line or more has been lost is
highly probable. In Snorri’s version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives
both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls
the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent’s
escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore.
The lines of stanzas 25 and 26 have been variously grouped.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but line 2 begins with a small letter. <i>A second wind</i>: another direction, i.e., he put about for the shore.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb147a">[<a href="#pb147a" class="pginternal">147</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> No superscription in the manuscripts. In its place Bugge supplies a line—“These words
spake Hymir,   |   the giant wise.” The manuscripts reverse the order of lines 2 and
3, and in both of them line 4 stands after stanza 28. <i>Goat of the flood</i>: boat.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Sea-horse</i>: boat. <i>Surf-swine</i>: the whales.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> Snorri says nothing of this episode of Hymir’s cup. The glass which cannot be broken
appears in the folklore of various races.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> <i>The loved one</i>: Hymir’s wife and Tyr’s mother; cf. stanza 8 and note. The idea that a giant’s skull
is harder than stone or anything else is characteristic of the later Norse folk-stories,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb148a">[<a href="#pb148a" class="pginternal">148</a>]</span>in one of the so-called “mythical sagas” we find a giant actually named Hard-Skull.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Helmet-stem</i>: head.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> The manuscripts have no superscription. Line 4 in the manuscripts is somewhat obscure,
and Bugge, followed by some editors, suggests a reading which may be rendered (beginning
with the second half of line 3): “No more can I speak / Ever again   |   as I spoke
of old.”
</p>
<p id="n1.7.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> <i>The father of Mothi</i> and <i>Sif’s husband</i>: Thor.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb149a">[<a href="#pb149a" class="pginternal">149</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.7.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>The many-headed</i>: The giants, although rarely designated as a race in this way, sometimes had two
or more heads; cf. stanza 8, <i>Skirnismol</i>, 31 and <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 33. Hymir’s mother is, however, the only many-headed giant actually to appear in
the action of the poems, and it is safe to assume that the tradition as a whole belongs
to the period of Norse folk-tales of the <i lang="de">märchen</i> order.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscripts. Some editors put the missing line as 2, some
as 3, and some, leaving the present three lines together, add a fourth, and metrically
incorrect, one from late paper manuscripts: “Who with Hymir   |   followed after.”
<i>Whales of the waste</i>: giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> According to Snorri, when Thor set out with Loki (not Tyr) for the giants’ land,
he stopped first at a peasant’s house (cf. stanza 7 and note). There he proceeded
to cook his own goats for supper. The peasant’s son, Thjalfi, eager to get at the
marrow, split one of the leg-bones with his knife. The next morning, when Thor was
ready to proceed with his journey, he called the goats to life again, but one of them
proved irretrievably lame. His wrath led the peasant to give him both his children
as <span class="pageNum" id="pb150a">[<a href="#pb150a" class="pginternal">150</a>]</span>servants (cf. stanza 39). Snorri does not indicate that Loki was in any way to blame.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> This deliberate introduction of the story-teller is exceedingly rare in the older
poetry.
</p>
<p id="n1.7.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.7.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> The translation of the last two lines is mostly guesswork, as the word rendered “gods”
is uncertain, and the one rendered “at the autumn-time” is quite obscure.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Lokasenna</i> is found only in <i>Regius</i>, where it follows the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.
</p>
<p>The poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been
preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was
dear to the Norse heart, and the <i>Lokasenna</i> consists chiefly of Loki’s taunts to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their
largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed
in mythological lore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere
recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part
of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.
</p>
<p>The prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem
closely to the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, much as the <i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i> and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue—very like
stage directions,—and provide a conclusion by relating Loki’s punishment, which, presumably,
is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was
recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker
inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed
this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The <i>Lokasenna</i> is certainly much older than the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century
compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work
he was annotating.</p>

<p class="first" id="prose1.8">Ægir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the
mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife.
Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif, <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152" class="pginternal">152</a>]</span>Thor’s wife, was there, and Bragi with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand,
was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him.
There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin.
Loki was there, and Freyr’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153" class="pginternal">153</a>]</span>servants Byggvir and Beyla. Many were there of the gods and elves.
</p>
<p>Ægir had two serving-men, Fimafeng and Eldir. Glittering gold they had in place of
firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised
much the ability of Ægir’s serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng.
Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest,
and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir.
Loki spoke to him:

the poison dropped on Loki. Then he struggled so hard that the whole earth shook therewith;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose1.8" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Ægir</i>: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his names, but he is not elsewhere
called Gymir, which is the name of the giant, Gerth’s father, in the <i>Skirnismol</i>. On Ægir cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 45, and <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 1. <i>Frigg</i>: though Othin’s wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic
poems; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 34, <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 1, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, introductory prose. <i>Thor</i>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor’s movements; the “journey
in the East” here mentioned cannot be the one described in the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor throughout that expedition.
He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. <i>Sif</i>: concerning Thor’s wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at
the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new
supply of hair out of gold; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 48. <i>Bragi</i>: the god of poetry; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44 and note. <i>Ithun</i>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on <i>Skirnismol</i>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells
in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference
in <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 19 (q. v.). <i>Tyr</i>: the god of battle; cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) <i>Voluspo</i>, 39, note. <i>Njorth</i>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of <i>Freyr</i> and <i>Freyja</i>; cf. (concerning the whole family) <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note, also <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note. <i>Skathi</i>: Njorth’s wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 19, note, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 11. <i>Vithar</i>: the silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf Fenrir;
cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 54, <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 51, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 17. <i>Loki</i>: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references to his career in
the <i>Lokasenna</i>, cf. particularly <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and 35, and notes. <i>Byggvir</i> and <i>Beyla</i>: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems; Freyr’s conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero
of the <i>Skirnismol</i>. <i>Fimafeng</i> (“The Swift Handler”) <span class="pageNum" id="pb153a">[<a href="#pb153a" class="pginternal">153</a>]</span>and <i>Eldir</i> (“The Man of the Fire”): mentioned only in connection with this incident. <i>Glittering gold</i>: Ægir’s use of gold to light his hall, which was often thought of as under the sea,
was responsible for the phrase “flame of the flood,” and sundry kindred phrases, meaning
“gold.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb154a">[<a href="#pb154a" class="pginternal">154</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Lopt</i>: like Lothur (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 18) another name for Loki; cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 43, and Svipdagsmol, 42.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza begins with a small letter, and Heinzel unites it with
stanza 6.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb155a">[<a href="#pb155a" class="pginternal">155</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Bragi</i>: cf. note on introductory prose. Why Loki taunts him with cowardice (stanzas 11–13–15)
is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi was the patron, was generally associated
in the Norse mind with peculiar valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise
noted fighters.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood,
but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The
common process of “mingling blood” was carried out quite literally, and the promise
of which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied
the ceremony; cf. <i>Brot af Sigurtharkvithu</i>, 18 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> In stanzas 10–31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the identity of the several
speakers, but these are uniformly clear <span class="pageNum" id="pb156a">[<a href="#pb156a" class="pginternal">156</a>]</span>enough through the context. <i>Vithar</i>: cf. note on introductory prose. <i>The wolf’s father</i>: Loki; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Sijmons makes one line of lines 4–5 by cutting out a part of each; Finnur Jonsson
rejects 5 as spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The text of line 4 is somewhat obscure, and has been <span class="pageNum" id="pb157a">[<a href="#pb157a" class="pginternal">157</a>]</span>variously emended, one often adopted suggestion making the line read, “Little is that
for thy lies.”
</p>
<p id="n1.8.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> <i>Adorner of benches</i>: this epithet presumably implies that Bragi is not only slothful, but also effeminate,
for a very similar word, “pride of the benches,” means a bride.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Ithun</i>: Bragi’s wife; cf. note on introductory prose. The goddesses who, finding that their
husbands are getting the worst of it, take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves
confronted with undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52
(Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar fashion. <i>Wish-son</i>: adopted son; Loki was the son of the giant Farbauti and the giantess Laufey, and
hence was not of the race of the gods, but had been virtually adopted by Othin, who
subsequently had good reason to regret it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158a">[<a href="#pb158a" class="pginternal">158</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> We do not even know who Ithun’s brother was, much less who slew him.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Gefjun</i>: a goddess, not elsewhere mentioned in the poems, who, according to Snorri, was served
by the women who died maidens. Beyond this nothing is known of her. Lines 3–4 in the
manuscript are puzzling, and have been freely emended.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Nothing is known of the incident here mentioned. There is a good deal of confusion
as to various of the gods and goddesses, and it has been suggested that Gefjun is
really Frigg under another name, with a little of Freyja—whose attributes were frequently
confused with Frigg’s—thrown in. Certainly Othin’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb159a">[<a href="#pb159a" class="pginternal">159</a>]</span>answer (stanza 21, lines 3–4) fits Frigg perfectly, for she shared his knowledge of
the future, whereas it has no relation to anything known of Gefjun. As for the necklace
(line 3), it may be the Brisings’ necklace, which appears in the <i>Thrymskvitha</i> as Freyja’s, but which, in some mythological writings, is assigned to Frigg.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> Snorri quotes line 1; cf. note on stanza 29.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> There is no other reference to Loki’s having spent eight years underground, or to
his cow-milking. On one occasion, however, he did bear offspring. A giant had undertaken
to build the gods a fortress, his reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided
the work was done by a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari. The
work being nearly done, and the gods fearing to lose Freyja and the sun and moon,
Loki <span class="pageNum" id="pb160a">[<a href="#pb160a" class="pginternal">160</a>]</span>turned himself into a mare, and so effectually distracted Svathilfari from his task
that shortly afterwards Loki gave birth to Othin’s eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. In
such contests of abuse a man was not infrequently taunted with having borne children;
cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 39–45. One or two of the last three lines may be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Samsey</i>: perhaps the Danish island of Samsö. Othin was the god of magic, but there is no
other reference to his ever having disguised himself as a witch.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> <i>Frigg</i>: Othin’s wife; cf. note to introductory prose.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Fjorgyn</i>: Othin; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 56 and note. <i>Vili</i> and <i>Ve</i>: Othin’s brothers, who appear merely as, with Othin, the sons of Bur and Bestla;
cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 4. The <i>Ynglingasaga</i> says that, during one of Othin’s protracted absences, his two brothers took Frigg
as their mistress. <i>Vithrir</i>: another name for Othin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb161a">[<a href="#pb161a" class="pginternal">161</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> On the death of Baldr, slain through Loki’s cunning by the blind Hoth, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>Freyja</i>: daughter of Njorth and sister of Freyr; cf. note on introductory prose. Snorri,
in speaking of Frigg’s knowledge of the future, makes a stanza out of <i>Lokasenna</i>, 21, 1; 47, 2; 29, 3–4, thus: “Mad art thou, Loki,   |   and little of wit, / Why,
Loki, leavst thou this not? / The fate of all   |   does Frigg know well, / Though
herself she says it not.”
</p>
<p id="n1.8.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> According to Snorri, Freyja was a model of fidelity to her husband, Oth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb162a">[<a href="#pb162a" class="pginternal">162</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> Before each of stanzas 32–42 the manuscript indicates the speaker, through the initial
letter of the name written in the margin. <i>Thy brother</i>: Freyr; there is no other indication that such a relation existed between these two,
but they themselves were the product of such a union; cf. stanza 36 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> <i>Njorth</i>: father of Freyr and Freyja, and given by the Wanes as a hostage, in exchange for
Hönir, at the close of the first war; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note, also <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note. <i>Babes</i>: cf. stanza 23 and note. Bugge suggests that this clause may have been a late insertion.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb163a">[<a href="#pb163a" class="pginternal">163</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Daughters of Hymir</i>: we have no clue to who these were, though Hymir is doubtless the frost-giant of
the <i>Hymiskvitha</i> (q.v.). Loki’s point is that Njorth is not a god, but the product of an inferior
race (the Wanes).
</p>
<p id="n1.8.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> <i>The son</i>: Freyr.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>Thy sister</i>: the <i>Ynglingasaga</i> supports this story of Njorth’s having had two children by his sister before he came
among the gods. Snorri, on the other hand, specifically says that Freyr and Freyja
were born after Njorth came to the gods.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> <i>Tyr</i>: the god of battle; cf. notes on <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 4, and <i>Voluspo</i>, 39. <i>Freyr</i>; concerning his noble qualities cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164a">[<a href="#pb164a" class="pginternal">164</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> Snorri mentions Tyr’s incompetence as a peacemaker. <i>Fenrir</i>: the wolf, Loki’s son; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Hrothvitnir</i> (“The Mighty Wolf”): Fenrir, who awaits in chains the final battle and death at the
hands of Vithar. The manuscript has a metrical error in line 3, which has led to various
emendations, all with much the same meaning.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> <i>Thy wife</i>: there is no other reference to Tyr’s wife, nor do we know who was the son in question.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb165a">[<a href="#pb165a" class="pginternal">165</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> <i>The mouth of the river</i>: according to Snorri, the chained Fenrir “roars horribly, and the slaver runs from
his mouth, and makes the river called Vam; he lies there till the doom of the gods.”
Freyr’s threat is actually carried out; cf. concluding prose.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> <i>The daughter of Gymir</i>: Gerth, heroine of the <i>Skirnismol</i>, which gives the details of Freyr’s loss of his sword. <i>Muspell’s sons</i>: the name Muspell is not used elsewhere in the poems; Snorri uses it frequently,
but only in this same phrase, “Muspell’s sons.” They are the dwellers in the fire-world,
Muspellsheim, led by Surt against the gods in the last battle; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 47 and 52 and notes. <i>Myrkwood</i>: here the dark forest bounding the fire-world; in the <i>Atlakvitha</i> (stanza 3) the name is used of another boundary forest.
</p>
<p id="n1.8.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> <i>Byggvir</i>: one of Freyr’s two servants; cf. introductory prose. <i>Ingunar-Freyr</i>: the name is not used elsewhere in the poems, or by Snorri; it may be the genitive
of a woman’s name, Ingun, the unknown sister of Njorth who was Freyr’s mother (cf.
stanza 36), or a corruption of the name Ingw, used for Freyr (Fro) in old German mythology.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb166a">[<a href="#pb166a" class="pginternal">166</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.8.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.8.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Beginning with this stanza, the names of the speakers are lacking in the manuscript.
<i>The mill</i>: i.e., at slaves’ tasks.
</p>

Narfi, into a wolf. Snorri turns the story about, Vali being the wolf, who tears his
brother to pieces, the gods then using Narfi’s intestines to bind Loki. Narfi—and
presumably Vali—were the sons of Loki and his wife, Sigyn. They appear only in this
episode, though Narfi (or Nari) is named by Snorri in his list of Loki’s children.

<p class="first">The <i>Thrymskvitha</i> is found only in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, where it follows the <i>Lokasenna</i>. Snorri does not quote from it, nor, rather oddly, does the story occur in the <i>Prose Edda</i>.
</p>
<p>Artistically the <i>Thrymskvitha</i> is one of the best, as it is, next to the <i>Voluspo</i>, the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called “the finest
ballad in the world,” and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the
sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to
make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know
nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of
extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere
about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested,
on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the <i>Skirnismol</i>, and possibly <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>. There is also some resemblance between the <i>Thrymskvitha</i> and the <i>Lokasenna</i> (note, in this connection, Bugge’s suggestion that the <i>Skirnismol</i> and the <i>Lokasenna</i> may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have
a single authorship.
</p>
<p>The <i>Thrymskvitha</i> has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations.
In striking contrast to many of the poems, it contains no prose narrative links, the
story being told in narrative verse—a rare phenomenon in the poems of the <i>Edda</i>.</p>

<p class="first" id="n1.9.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Vingthor</i> (“Thor the Hurler”): another name for Thor, equivalent to Vingnir (<i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 51). Concerning Thor and his hammer, Mjollnir, cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, <i>Lokasenna</i>, and <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, <i>passim</i>. <i>Jorth</i>: Earth, Thor’s mother, Othin being his father.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb175a">[<a href="#pb175a" class="pginternal">175</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.9.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Loki</i>: cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, <i>passim</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Freyja</i>: Njorth’s daughter, and sister of Freyr; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, introductory prose and note, also <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose. Freyja’s house was Sessrymnir (“Rich in Seats”) built in Folkvang
(“Field of the Folk”); cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 14. <i>Feather-dress</i>: this flying equipment of Freyja’s is also used in the story of Thjazi, wherein Loki
again borrows the “hawk’s dress” of Freyja, this time to rescue Ithun; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 19 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> The manuscript and most editions have lines 1–2 in inverse order. Several editors
assume a lacuna before line 1, making a stanza out of the two conjectural lines (Bugge
actually supplies them) and lines 1–2 of stanza 4. Thus they either make a separate
stanza out of lines 3–5 or unite them in a six-line stanza with 5. The manuscript
punctuation and capitalization—not <span class="pageNum" id="pb176a">[<a href="#pb176a" class="pginternal">176</a>]</span>wholly trustworthy guides—indicate the stanza divisions as in this translation.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Thrym</i>: a frost-giant. Gering declares that this story of the theft of Thor’s hammer symbolizes
the fact that thunderstorms rarely occur in winter.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Line 1</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 48, 1. The manuscript does not indicate Loki as the speaker of lines 3–4. <i>Hlorrithi</i>: Thor.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> No superscription in the manuscript. Vigfusson made up <span class="pageNum" id="pb177a">[<a href="#pb177a" class="pginternal">177</a>]</span>and inserted lines like “Then spake Loki   |   the son of Laufey” whenever he thought
they would be useful.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 2, instead of line 1, as the beginning of a stanza, which
has caused editors some confusion in grouping the lines of stanzas 8 and 9.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> No superscription in the manuscript.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Many editors have rejected either line 2 or line 3. Vigfusson inserts one of his
own lines before line 4. <i>Brisings’ necklace</i>: a marvelous necklace fashioned by the dwarfs, here called Brisings (i.e., “Twiners”);
cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 20 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb178a">[<a href="#pb178a" class="pginternal">178</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.9.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Lines 1–3 are identical with <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>, 1, 1–3.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Heimdall</i>: the phrase “whitest of the gods” suggests that Heimdall was the god of light as
well as being the watchman. His wisdom was probably connected with his sleepless watching
over all the worlds; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 47 and note. On the Wanes cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note. They are not elsewhere spoken of as peculiarly gifted with knowledge
of future events.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Laufey</i>: Loki’s mother, cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 52 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179a">[<a href="#pb179a" class="pginternal">179</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.9.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.18" class="pginternal">18–19</a>.</span> The manuscript abbreviates all six lines, giving only the initial letters of the
words. The stanza division is thus arbitrary; some editors have made one stanza of
the six lines, others have combined the last two lines of stanza 19 with stanza 20.
It is possible that a couple of lines have been lost.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Goats</i>: Thor’s wagon was always drawn by goats; cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 38 and note. <i>Jotunheim</i>: the world of the giants.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Njorth</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 11 and 16. <i>Noatun</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb180a">[<a href="#pb180a" class="pginternal">180</a>]</span>(“Ships’-Haven”): Njorth’s home, where his wife, Skathi, found it impossible to stay;
cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 11 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> Grundtvig thinks this is all that is left of two stanzas describing Thor’s supper.
Some editors reject line 4. In line 3 the manuscript has “he,” the reference being,
of course, to Thor, on whose appetite cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 15. <i>Sif</i>: Thor’s wife; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, note to introductory prose and stanza 53.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb181a">[<a href="#pb181a" class="pginternal">181</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.9.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> For clearness I have inserted Thrym’s name in place of the pronoun of the original.
<i>Fire</i>: the noun is lacking in the manuscript; most editors have inserted it, however, following
a late paper manuscript.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> In the manuscript the whole stanza is abbreviated to initial letters, except for
“sleep,” “Freyja,” and “found.”
</p>
<p id="n1.9.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>Luckless</i>: so the manuscript, but many editors have altered the word “arma” to “aldna,” meaning
“old,” to correspond with line 1 of stanza 32. Line 5 may well be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> <i>Hallow</i>: just what this means is not clear, but there are <span class="pageNum" id="pb182a">[<a href="#pb182a" class="pginternal">182</a>]</span>references to other kinds of consecration, though not of a bride, with the “sign of
the hammer.” According to Vigfusson, “the hammer was the holy sign with the heathens,
answering to the cross of the Christians.” In Snorri’s story of Thor’s resuscitation
of his cooked goat (cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 38, note) the god “hallows” the goat with his hammer. One of the oldest runic signs,
supposed to have magic power, was named Thor’s-hammer. <i>Vor</i>: the goddess of vows, particularly between men and women; Snorri lists a number of
little-known goddesses similar to Vor, all of them apparently little more than names
for Frigg.
</p>
<p id="n1.9.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.9.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Some editors reject this line, which, from a dramatic standpoint, is certainly a
pity. In the manuscript it begins with a capital letter, like the opening of a new
stanza.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering’s statement that “it is
a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.” The narrative skeleton, contained solely
in stanzas 1–8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying
Thor’s daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his
knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever
to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks
what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called “in each of all the worlds,”
but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one
thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions,
or “kennings.” Concerning the use of these “kennings” in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory
note to the <i>Hymiskvitha</i>.
</p>
<p>Mogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning
it to the period of “the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.” It appears to have
been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,—Thor’s questions, for instance,
are neatly balanced in pairs,—and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction,
but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous
poetry. Finnur Jonsson’s attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles
logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence,
which is by no means incompatible with Mogk’s theory (cf. introductory note to the
<i>Rigsthula</i>).
</p>
<p>The poem is found only in <i>Regius</i>, where it follows the <i>Thrymskvitha</i>. Snorri quotes stanzas 20 and 30, the manuscripts of the <i>Prose Edda</i> giving the name of the poem as <i>Alvissmol</i>, <i>Alsvinnsmol</i> or <i>Olvismol</i>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission,
although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily
as to defy detection.
</p>
<p>The translation of the many synonyms presents, of course, <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184" class="pginternal">184</a>]</span>unusual difficulties, particularly as many of the Norse words can be properly rendered
in English only by more or less extended phrases. I have kept to the original meanings
as closely as I could without utterly destroying the metrical structure.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n1.10.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Alvis</i> (“All-Knowing”): a dwarf, not elsewhere mentioned. The manuscript nowhere indicates
the speakers’ names. The bride in question is Thor’s daughter; Thruth (“Might”) is
the only daughter of his whose name is recorded, and she does not appear elsewhere
in the poems. Her mother was Sif, Thor’s wife, whereas the god’s sons were born of
a giantess. <i>Benches</i>: cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 15 and note.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> The dwarfs, living beyond the reach of the sun, which was fatal to them (cf. stanzas
16 and 35), were necessarily pale. Line 3 is, of course, ironical.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Wagon-guider</i>: Thor, who travels habitually on his goat-drawn wagon. Bugge changes “Vagna vers”
to “Vapna verþs,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb185a">[<a href="#pb185a" class="pginternal">185</a>]</span>rendering the line “I am come to seek   |   the cost of the weapons.” In either case,
Alvis does not as yet recognize Thor.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> Apparently the gods promised Thor’s daughter in marriage to Alvis during her father’s
absence, perhaps as a reward for some craftsmanship of his (cf. Bugge’s suggestion
as to stanza 3). The text of line 4 is most uncertain.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Hero</i>: ironically spoken; Alvis takes Thor for a tramp, the god’s uncouth appearance often
leading to such mistakes; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 6. Line 4 is a trifle uncertain; some editors alter the wording to read “What worthless
woman bore thee?”
</p>
<p id="n1.10.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Vingthor</i> (“Thor the Hurler”): cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 1. <i>Sithgrani</i> (“Long-Beard”): Othin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb186a">[<a href="#pb186a" class="pginternal">186</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Every world</i>: concerning the nine worlds, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 2 and note. Many editors follow this stanza with one spoken by Alvis, found in late
paper manuscripts, as follows: “Ask then, Vingthor,   |   since eager thou art / The
lore of the dwarf to learn; / Oft have I fared   |   in the nine worlds all, / And
wide is my wisdom of each.”
</p>
<p id="n1.10.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> <i>Men</i>, etc.: nothing could more clearly indicate the author’s mythological inaccuracy than
his confusion of the inhabitants of the nine worlds. Men (dwellers in Mithgarth) appear
in each of Alvis’s thirteen answers; so do the gods (Asgarth) and the giants (Jotunheim).
The elves (Alfheim) appear in eleven <span class="pageNum" id="pb187a">[<a href="#pb187a" class="pginternal">187</a>]</span>answers, the Wanes (Vanaheim) in nine, and the dwarfs (who occupied no special world,
unless one identifies them with the dark elves of Svartalfaheim) in seven. The dwellers
“in hell” appear in six stanzas; the phrase probably refers to the world of the dead,
though Mogk thinks it may mean the dwarfs. In stanzas where the gods are already listed
appear names elsewhere applied only to them,—“holy ones,” “sons of the gods” and “high
ones,”—as if these names meant beings of a separate race. “Men” appears twice in the
same stanza, and so do the giants, if one assumes that they are “the sons of Suttung.”
Altogether it is useless to pay much attention to the mythology of Alvis’s replies.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Lines 1, 2, and 4 of Thor’s questions are regularly abbreviated in the manuscript.
<i>Beheld</i>, etc.: the word in the manuscript is almost certainly an error, and all kinds of
guesses have been made to rectify it. All that can be said is that it means “beheld
of” or “known to” somebody.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb188a">[<a href="#pb188a" class="pginternal">188</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Flame</i>: a doubtful word; Vigfusson suggests that it properly means a “mock sun.” <i>Wheel</i>: the manuscript adds the adjective “whirling,” to the destruction of the metre; cf.
<i>Hovamol</i>, 84, 3.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Deceiver of Dvalin</i>: Dvalin was one of the foremost dwarfs; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 14, <i>Fafnismol</i>, 13, and <i>Hovamol</i>, 144. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb189a">[<a href="#pb189a" class="pginternal">189</a>]</span>sun “deceives” him because, like the other dwarfs living underground, he cannot live
in its light, and always fears lest sunrise may catch him unaware. The sun’s rays
have power to turn the dwarfs into stone, and the giantess Hrimgerth meets a similar
fate (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 30). Alvis suffers in the same way; cf. stanza 35.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza in the <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>. <i>Waverer</i>: the word is uncertain, the <i>Prose Edda</i> manuscripts giving it in various forms. <i>Blustering Blast</i>: two <i>Prose Edda</i> manuscripts give a totally different word, meaning “The Pounder.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb190a">[<a href="#pb190a" class="pginternal">190</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Hush</i>, etc.: the manuscript, by inserting an additional letter, makes the word practically
identical with that translated “Kite” in stanza 18. Most editors have agreed as to
the emendation.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Drink-Stuff</i>: Gering translates the word thus; I doubt it, but can suggest nothing better.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb191a">[<a href="#pb191a" class="pginternal">191</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Wildfire</i>: the word may mean any one of various things, including “Wave,” which is not unlikely.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>In hell</i>: the word simply means “men,” and it is only a guess, though a generally accepted
one, that here it refers to the dead.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb192a">[<a href="#pb192a" class="pginternal">192</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>Nor</i>: presumably the giant whom Snorri calls Norvi or Narfi, father of Not (Night) and
grandfather of Dag (Day). Cf. <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 25.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza in the <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>. The various <i>Prose Edda</i> manuscripts differ considerably in naming the gods, the giants, etc. <i>Lightless</i>: some manuscripts have “The Unsorrowing.”
</p>
<p id="n1.10.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Grain</i>: the two words translated “grain” and “corn” apparently both meant primarily barley,
and thence grain in <span class="pageNum" id="pb193a">[<a href="#pb193a" class="pginternal">193</a>]</span>general, the first being the commoner term of the two. <i>Drink-Stuff</i>: the word is identical with the one used, and commented on, in stanza 24, and again
I have followed Gering’s interpretation for want of a better one. If his guess is
correct, the reference here is evidently to grain as the material from which beer
and other drinks are brewed.
</p>
<p id="n1.10.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Suttung’s sons</i>: these ought to be the giants, but the giants are specifically mentioned in line
3. The phrase “Suttung’s sons” occurs in <i>Skirnismol</i>, 34, clearly meaning the giants. Concerning Suttung as the possessor of the mead
of poetry, cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 104.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb194a">[<a href="#pb194a" class="pginternal">194</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.10.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.10.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Concerning the inability of the dwarfs to endure sunlight, which turns them into
stone, cf. stanza 16 and note. Line 5 may be spurious.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Baldrs Draumar</i> is found only in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, where it follows the <i>Harbarthsljoth</i> fragment. It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title <i>Vegtamskvitha</i> (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.
</p>
<p>The poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent
condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the <i>Voluspo</i>. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the <i>Voluspo</i>, 32–33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those
and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that <i>Baldrs Draumar</i> and the <i>Voluspo</i> may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between
<i>Baldrs Draumar</i> and the <i>Thrymskvitha</i> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson’s guess that these
two poems had a common authorship. In any case, <i>Baldrs Draumar</i> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.
</p>
<p>Whether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the <i>Voluspo</i> is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition.
As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies
the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the
dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr’s evil dreams; in the <i>Voluspo</i> it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.
</p>
<p>The poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather
than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who
heard the poem recited.</p>

<p class="first" id="n1.11.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> Lines 1–3 are identical with <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 13, 1–3. <i>Baldr</i>: concerning this best and noblest of the gods, the son of Othin and <span class="pageNum" id="pb196a">[<a href="#pb196a" class="pginternal">196</a>]</span>Frigg, who comes again among the survivors after the final battle, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32 and 62, and notes. He is almost never mentioned anywhere except in connection
with the story of his death, though Snorri has one short passage praising his virtue
and beauty. After stanza 1 two old editions, and one later one, insert four stanzas
from late paper manuscripts.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Sleipnir</i>: Othin’s eight-legged horse, the son of Loki and the stallion Svathilfari; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 23, and <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44, and notes. <i>Niflhel</i>: the murky (“nifl”) dwelling of Hel, goddess of the dead. <i>The hound</i>: Garm; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 44.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Father of magic</i>: Othin appears constantly as the god of magic. <i>Hel</i>: offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha, as were the wolf Fenrir and Mithgarthsorm.
She ruled the world of the unhappy dead, either those who had led evil lives or, according
to another tradition, those who had not died in battle. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb197a">[<a href="#pb197a" class="pginternal">197</a>]</span>manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and thus the editions vary in
their grouping of the lines of this and the succeeding stanzas.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> The manuscript has no superscriptions indicating the speakers. <i>Vegtam</i> (“The Wanderer”): Othin, as usual, conceals his identity, calling himself the son
of Valtam (“The Fighter”). In this instance he has unusual need to do so, for as the
wise-woman belongs apparently to the race of the giants, she would be unwilling to
answer a god’s questions. <i>Heaven</i>: the word used includes all the upper worlds, in contrast to hell. <i>Benches</i>, etc.: the adornment of the benches and raised platforms, or elevated parts of the
house, was a regular part of the preparation for a feast of welcome. The text of the
two last lines is somewhat uncertain.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Grundtvig, followed by Edzardi, thinks a line has been lost between lines 3 and 4.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb198a">[<a href="#pb198a" class="pginternal">198</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.11.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> Concerning the blind Hoth, who, at Loki’s instigation, cast the fatal mistletoe at
Baldr, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32–33 and notes. In the manuscript the last line is abbreviated, as also in stanza
11.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> In the manuscript lines 1–2 are abbreviated, as also in stanza 12.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> <i>Rind</i>: mentioned by Snorri as one of the goddesses. Concerning her son Vali, begotten by
Othin for the express purpose of avenging Baldr’s death, and his slaying of Hoth the
day after his birth, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 33–34, where the lines of this stanza appear practically verbatim. <i>Vestrsalir</i> (“The Western Hall”): not elsewhere mentioned in the poems.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb199a">[<a href="#pb199a" class="pginternal">199</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.11.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> The manuscript marks the third line as the beginning of a stanza; something may have
been lost. Lines 3–4 are thoroughly obscure. According to Bugge the maidens who are
to weep for Baldr are the daughters of the sea-god Ægir, the waves, whose grief will
be so tempestuous that they will toss the ships up to the very sky. “Yards of the
sails” is a doubtfully accurate rendering; the two words, at any rate in later Norse
nautical speech, meant respectively the “tack” and the “sheet” of the square sail.
</p>
<p id="n1.11.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Possibly two separate stanzas. <i>Enchanter</i>: the meaning of the original word is most uncertain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb200a">[<a href="#pb200a" class="pginternal">200</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.11.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.11.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> Concerning Loki’s escape and his relation to the destruction of the gods, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 35 and 51, and notes. While the wise-woman probably means only that she will never
speak again till the end of the world, it has been suggested, and is certainly possible,
that she intends to give Loki her counsel, thus revenging herself on Othin.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Rigsthula</i> is found in neither of the principal codices. The only manuscript containing it is
the so-called <i lang="la">Codex Wormanius</i>, a manuscript of Snorri’s <i>Prose Edda</i>. The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete,
and thus the end of the poem is lacking. In the <i lang="la">Codex Wormanius</i> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls
the poem the <i>Rigsthula</i>. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of <i>Rigsmol</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>Rigsthula</i> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called
<i>Edda</i>. It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin
of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors.
From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus
the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate. This fact in itself would
suffice to indicate that the <i>Rigsthula</i> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound
disapproval.
</p>
<p>Not only does the <i>Rigsthula</i> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a
particular king. The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the
connection between the mythical “Young Kon” (Konr ungr, konungr, “king”; but cf. stanza
44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established. Owing to the character
of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search
for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments
advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that
such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region
where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson’s claim for Norway, with
Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than
Mogk’s ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark,
in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on
the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202" class="pginternal">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer,
who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of
the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts. The extent of Celtic influence
on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims
almost all the poems for the “Western Isles,” and attributes nearly all their good
qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the details of
the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly
recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact
between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the
“Western Isles,” and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption
of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.
</p>
<p>In the case of the <i>Rigsthula</i> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name
Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic
words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit. This
explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general.
On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation
that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time
in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits
the ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced into Denmark
around 960, the <i>Rigsthula</i> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to
the first half of the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was
succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.
</p>
<p>The fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall,
but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant
this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his
purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The
evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory
prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology,
and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the
Norse mind.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose1.12" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant by the phrase <i>old stories</i>. Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so,
his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying <i>Rig</i> as <i>Heimdall</i>, he provides no information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer
to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall
may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own. The note was presumably
written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting
the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor
the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather
vague passages in the other poems. Thus in <i>Voluspo</i>, 1, the Volva asks hearing “from Heimdall’s sons both high and low”; in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall “o’er men holds sway,
it is said,” and in “the Short Voluspo” (<i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 40) he is called “the kinsman of men.” On the other hand, everything in the <i>Rigsthula</i>, including the phrase “the aged and wise” in stanza 1, and the references to runes
in stanzas 36, 44, and 46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the
annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. <i>Rig</i>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for “king,” “ri” or “rig.”
</p>
<p id="n1.12.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> No gap is indicated, but editors have generally assumed one. Some editors, however,
add line 1 of stanza 2 to stanza 1.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb204a">[<a href="#pb204a" class="pginternal">204</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> Most editions make line 5 a part of the stanza, as here, but some indicate it as
the sole remnant of one or more stanzas descriptive of Ai and Edda, just as Afi and
Amma, Fathir and Mothir, are later described. <i>Ai and Edda</i>: Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother; the latter name was responsible for Jakob
Grimm’s famous guess at the meaning of the word “Edda” as applied to the whole collection
(cf. Introduction).
</p>
<p id="n1.12.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> A line may have been lost from this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> Line 5 has generally been rejected as spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> The manuscript has lines 1–2 in inverse order, but marks the word “Rig” as the beginning
of a stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205a">[<a href="#pb205a" class="pginternal">205</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate that these lines form a separate stanza, and as
only one line and a fragment of another are left of stanza 7, the editions have grouped
the lines in all sorts of ways, with, of course, various conjectures as to where lines
may have been lost.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> After line 1 the manuscript has only four words: “cloth,” “black,” “named,” and “Thræll.”
No gap is anywhere indicated. Editors have pieced out the passage in various ways.
<i>Water</i>, etc.: concerning the custom of sprinkling water on children, which long antedated
the introduction of Christianity, cf. <i>Hovamol</i>, 159 and note. <i>Black</i>: dark hair, among the blond Scandinavians, was the mark of a foreigner, hence of
a slave. <i>Thræll</i>: Thrall or Slave.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> In the manuscript line 1 of stanza 9 stands before stanza 8, neither line being capitalized
as the beginning of a stanza. I have followed Bugge’s rearrangement. The manuscript
indicates no gap in line 2, but nearly all editors have assumed one, Grundtvig supplying
“and rough his nails.”
</p>
<p id="n1.12.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 2 as the beginning of a stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb206a">[<a href="#pb206a" class="pginternal">206</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> A line may well have dropped out, but the manuscript is too uncertain as to the stanza-divisions
to make any guess safe. <i>Crooked</i>: the word in the original is obscure. <i>Stained</i>: literally, “water was on her soles.” <i>Thir</i>: “Serving-Woman.”
</p>
<p id="n1.12.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> There is some confusion as to the arrangement of the lines and division into stanzas
of 12 and 13. The names mean: <i>Fjosnir</i>, “Cattle-Man”; <i>Klur</i>, “The Coarse”; <i>Hreim</i>, “The Shouter”; <i>Kleggi</i>, “The Horse-Fly”; <i>Kefsir</i>, “Concubine-Keeper”; <i>Fulnir</i>, “The Stinking”; <i>Drumb</i>, “The Log”; <i>Digraldi</i>, “The Fat”; <i>Drott</i>, “The Sluggard”; <i>Leggjaldi</i>, “The Big-Legged”; <i>Lut</i>, “The Bent”; <i>Hosvir</i>, “The Grey.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb207a">[<a href="#pb207a" class="pginternal">207</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> The names mean: <i>Drumba</i>, “The Log”; <i>Kumba</i>, “The Stumpy”; <i>Ökkvinkalfa</i>, “Fat-Legged”; <i>Arinnefja</i>, “Homely-Nosed”; <i>Ysja</i>, “The Noisy”; <i>Ambott</i>, “The Servant”; <i>Eikintjasna</i>, “The Oaken Peg” (?); <i>Totrughypja</i>, “Clothed in Rags”; <i>Tronubeina</i>, “Crane-Legged.”
</p>
<p id="n1.12.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> In the manuscript line 4 stands after line 4 of stanza 16, but several editors have
rearranged the lines, as here. <i>Afi and Amma</i>: Grandfather and Grandmother.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> There is considerable confusion among the editors as to where this stanza begins
and ends.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb208a">[<a href="#pb208a" class="pginternal">208</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> The manuscript jumps from stanza 17, line 1, to stanza 19, line 2. Bugge points out
that the copyist’s eye was presumably led astray by the fact that 17, 1, and 19, 1,
were identical. Lines 2–3 of 17 are supplied from stanzas 3 and 29.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> I have followed Bugge’s conjectural construction of the missing stanza, taking lines
2 and 3 from stanzas 31 and 4.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 2 as the beginning of a stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The manuscript omits line 2, supplied by analogy with stanza 6.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb209a">[<a href="#pb209a" class="pginternal">209</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.12.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> Most editors assume a lacuna, after either line 2 or line 3. Sijmons assumes, on
the analogy of stanza 8, that a complete stanza describing <i>Karl</i> (“Yeoman”) has been lost between stanzas 21 and 22.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> No line indicated in the manuscript as beginning a stanza. <i>Cart</i>: the word in the original, “kartr,” is one of the clear signs of the Celtic influence
noted in the introduction.
</p>
<p id="n1.12.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.12.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Bring</i>: the word literally means “drove in a wagon”—a mark of the bride’s social status.
<i>Snör</i>: “Daughter-in-Law.” Bugge, followed by several editors, maintains that line 4 was
wrongly interpolated here from a missing stanza describing the marriage of Kon.
</p>

two lines, and not enough for the full three. The meaning, however, is clearly very
much as indicated in the translation. Gering’s emendation, which I have followed,
consists simply in shifting “set before them” from the first line to the second—where
the manuscript has no verb,—and supplying the verb “brought” in line 1. The various
editions contain all sorts of suggestions.

in conjunction with the obviously defective state of the following stanza, has led
to all sorts of conjectural emendations. The exact significance of Rig’s giving his
own name to Jarl (cf. stanza 46), and thus recognizing him, potentially at least,
as a king, depends on the conditions under <span class="pageNum" id="pb213a">[<a href="#pb213a" class="pginternal">213</a>]</span>which the poem was composed (cf. Introductory Note). The whole stanza, particularly

Concerning the use made of this last name, see note on stanza
44. It is curious that there is no list of the daughters of Jarl and Erna, and accordingly
Vigfusson inserts here the names listed in stanza 25. Grundtvig rearranges the lines
of stanzas 42 and 43.

word meaning “king.” The “kon” part is actually not far out, but the second syllable
of “konungr” has nothing to do with “ungr” meaning “young.” <i>Runes</i>: a long list of just such magic charms, dulling swordblades, quenching flames, and
so on, is given in <i>Hovamol</i>, 147–163.

a line has disappeared, or, as seems more likely, the gap includes two lines and a

According to the Latin epitome of the <i>Skjöldungasaga</i> by Arngrimur Jonsson, “Rig (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of
his time. He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name
was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir
his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.” This
may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off
abruptly at this stanza.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Hyndluljoth</i> is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, but is included in the so-called <i>Flateyjarbok</i> (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made somewhere about 1400. The
lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition
in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have
of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them,
clumsily put together. The longer one, the <i>Poem of Hyndla</i> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging
to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being
asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding
a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the
popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet
was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the <i>Hyndluljoth</i> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must
have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the
poem seems rather like a product of the archæological period of Iceland.
</p>
<p>Inserted bodily in the <i>Hyndluljoth</i> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious
chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it “the short <i>Voluspo</i>.” The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original
poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great <i>Voluspo</i>. Like the <i>Hyndluljoth</i> proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever
to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected
in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did
not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted “the short <i>Voluspo</i>.”
</p>
<p>Neither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of
“the short <i>Voluspo</i>” seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets
were <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218" class="pginternal">218</a>]</span>too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school. The names of Hyndla’s
heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have
no direct relation to the poems of the <i>Edda</i>, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and
the saga-groups in which they appeared.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n1.13.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Freyja</i>: The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscripts. On Freyja cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21 and note; <i>Skirnismol</i>, introductory prose and note; <i>Lokasenna</i>, introductory prose and note. As stanzas 9–10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his
entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry,
and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja
to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes
of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess <i>Hyndla</i> (“She-Dog”) to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Heerfather</i>: Othin; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 30. <i>Hermoth</i>: mentioned in the <i>Prose Edda</i> as a son of Othin who is sent to Hel to ask for the return of the slain Baldr. <i>Sigmund</i>: according to the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Sigmund was the son of Volsung, and hence Othin’s great-great-grandson (note that
Wagner eliminates all the intervening generations by the simple expedient of using
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219a">[<a href="#pb219a" class="pginternal">219</a>]</span>Volsung’s name as one of Othin’s many appellations). Sigmund alone was able to draw
from the tree the sword which a mysterious stranger (Othin, of course) had thrust
into it (compare the first act of Wagner’s <i lang="de">Die Walküre</i>).
</p>
<p id="n1.13.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> Sijmons suggests that this stanza may be an interpolation.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> No lacuna after line 2 is indicated in the manuscript. Editors have attempted various
experiments in rearranging this and the following stanza.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign
to her lines 3–4. Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other
arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript’s “thy” in line 3 to “my,”
as suggested by Bugge. The boar on which Freyja rides (“my worthy steed”) is, of course,
Ottar.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Hyndla detects Ottar, and accuses Freyja of having her <span class="pageNum" id="pb220a">[<a href="#pb220a" class="pginternal">220</a>]</span>lover with her. Unless Ottar is identical with Oth (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 25 and note), which seems most unlikely, there is no other reference to this love
affair. <i>The way of the slain</i>: the road to Valhall.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Various experiments have been made in condensing the stanza into four lines, or in
combining it with stanza 8. <i>Hildisvini</i> (“Battle-Swine”): perhaps Freyja refers to the boar with golden bristles given, according
to Snorri, to her brother Freyr by the dwarfs. <i>Dain</i>: a dwarf; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 11. <i>Nabbi</i>: a dwarf nowhere else mentioned.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> The first line is obviously corrupt in the manuscript, and has been variously emended.
The general assumption is that in the interval between stanzas 7 and 8 Freyja and
Hyndla have arrived at Valhall. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscript.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>Foreign metal</i>: gold. The word <i>valr</i>, meaning “foreign,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb221a">[<a href="#pb221a" class="pginternal">221</a>]</span>and akin to “Welsh,” is interesting in this connection, and some editors interpret
it frankly as “Celtic,” i.e., Irish.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> <i>To glass</i>: i.e., the constant fires on the altar have fused the stone into glass. Glass beads,
etc., were of very early use, though the use of glass for windows probably did not
begin in Iceland much before 1200.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Possibly two stanzas, or perhaps one with interpolations. The manuscript omits the
first half of line 4, here filled out from stanza 16, line 2. <i>Skjoldungs</i>: the descendants of Skjold, a mythical king who was Othin’s son and the ancestor
of the Danish kings; cf. Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>, <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>, 43. <i>Skilfings</i>: mentioned by Snorri as descendants of King Skelfir, a mythical ruler in “the East.”
In <i>Grimnismol</i>, 54, the name Skilfing appears as one of Othin’s many appellations. <i>Othlings</i>: Snorri derives this race from Authi, the son of Halfdan the Old (cf. stanza 14).
<i>Ylfings</i>: some editors have changed this to “Ynglings,” as in stanza 16, referring to the
descendants of Yng or Yngvi, another son of Halfdan, but the reference may be to the
same mythical family to which Helgi Hundingsbane belonged (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 5).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb222a">[<a href="#pb222a" class="pginternal">222</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>Instein</i>: mentioned in the <i>Halfssaga</i> as one of the warriors of King Half of Horthaland (the so-called Halfsrekkar). The
others mentioned in this stanza appear in one of the later mythical accounts of the
settlement of Norway.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> Stanzas 14–16 are clearly interpolated, as Friaut (stanza 13, line 3) is the daughter
of Hildigun (stanza 17, line 1). <i>Halfdan</i> the Old, a mythical king of Denmark, called by Snorri “the most famous of all kings,”
of whom it was foretold that “for three hundred years there should be no woman and
no man in his line who was not of great repute.” After the slaying of Sigtrygg he
married Almveig (or Alvig), daughter of King Eymund of Holmgarth (i.e., Russia), who
bore him eighteen <span class="pageNum" id="pb223a">[<a href="#pb223a" class="pginternal">223</a>]</span>sons, nine at one birth. These nine were all slain, but the other nine were traditionally
the ancestors of the most famous families in Northern hero lore.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Compare stanza 11. All or part of this stanza may be interpolated.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Hildigun</i> (or Hildiguth): with this the poem returns to Ottar’s direct ancestry, Hildigun being
Friaut’s mother. <i>Line 4</i>: cf. the refrain-line in the <i>Voluspo</i> (stanzas 27, 29, etc.).
</p>
<p id="n1.13.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> Another interpolation, as Ketil (stanza 19, line 1) is the husband of Hildigun (stanza
17). <i>Dag</i>: one of Halfdan’s sons, and ancestor of the Döglings. Line 5 may be a late addition.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Ketil</i>: the semi-mythical Ketil Hortha-Kari, from whom various Icelandic families traced
their descent. <i>Hoalf</i>: probably King Half of Horthaland, hero of the <i>Halfssaga</i>, and son of Hjorleif and Hild (cf. stanza 12, note).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb224a">[<a href="#pb224a" class="pginternal">224</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> <i>Nanna</i>: the manuscript has “Manna.” Of Nanna and her father, Nokkvi, we know nothing, but
apparently Nanna’s son married a sister of Instein, Ottar’s father.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Olmoth</i>: one of the sons of Ketil Hortha-Kari. <i>Line 4</i>: here, and generally hereafter when it appears in the poem, this refrain-line is
abbreviated in the manuscript to the word “all.”
</p>
<p id="n1.13.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> An isolated stanza, which some editors place after stanza 24, others combining lines
1–2 with the fragmentary stanza 23. In the manuscript lines 3–4 stand after stanza
24, where they fail to connect clearly with anything. <i>Hrolf the Old</i>: probably King Hrolf Gautreksson of Gautland, in the saga relating to whom (<i>Fornaldar sögur</i> III, 57 ff.) appear the names of Thorir the Iron-shield and Grim Thorkelsson.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb225a">[<a href="#pb225a" class="pginternal">225</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Stanzas 23 and 24 name the twelve Berserkers, the sons of Arngrim and Eyfura, the
story of whom is told in the <i>Hervararsaga</i> and the <i>Orvar-Oddssaga</i>. Saxo Grammaticus tells of the battle between them and Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd. Line
1 does not appear in the manuscript, but is added from the list of names given in
the sagas. The Berserkers were wild warriors, distinguished above all by the fits
of frenzy to which they were subject in battle; during these fits they howled like
wild beasts, foamed at the mouth, and gnawed the iron rims of their shields. At such
times they were proof against steel or fire, but when the fever abated they were weak.
The etymology of the word <i>berserk</i> is disputed; probably, however, it means “bear-shirt.”
</p>
<p id="n1.13.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> The manuscript omits the first half of line 1, here supplied from the <i>Orvar-Oddssaga</i>. <i>Bolm</i>: probably the island of Bolmsö, in the Swedish province of <span class="corr" title="Source: Smaland" id="xd32e16339">Småland</span>. In the manuscript and in most editions stanza 24 is followed by lines 3–4 of stanza
22. Some editors reject line 5 as spurious.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> In the manuscript line 1 stands after line 4 of stanza 29. Probably a stanza enumerating
Jormunrek’s sons has been lost. Many editors combine lines 3–4 of stanza 22 and lines
2–4 of <span class="pageNum" id="pb226a">[<a href="#pb226a" class="pginternal">226</a>]</span>stanza 25 into one stanza. <i>Jormunrek</i>: the historical Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about 376. According to Norse
tradition, in which Jormunrek played a large part, he slew his own sons (cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> and <i>Hamthesmol</i>). In the saga Jormunrek married Sigurth’s daughter, Svanhild. Stanzas 25–27 connect
Ottar’s descent with the whole Volsung-Sigurth-Jormunrek-Gjuki genealogy. The story
of <i>Sigurth</i> is the basis for most of the heroic poems of the <i>Edda</i>, of the famous <i>Volsungasaga</i>, and, in Germany, of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. On his battle with the dragon <i>Fafnir</i> cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Volsung</i>: Sigurth’s grandfather and Othin’s great-grandson. <i>Hjordis</i>: daughter of King Eylimi, wife of Sigmund and mother of Sigurth. <i>Othlings</i>: cf. stanza 11.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> <i>Gunnar</i>, <i>Hogni</i>, and <i>Guthrun</i>: the three children of the Burgundian king <i>Gjuki</i> and his wife Grimhild (Kriemhild); Guthrun was Sigurth’s wife. <i>Gotthorm</i>, the third brother, who killed Sigurth at Brynhild’s behest, was Grimhild’s son,
and thus a step-son of Gjuki. These four play an important part in the heroic cycle
of Eddic poems. Cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb227a">[<a href="#pb227a" class="pginternal">227</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> In the manuscript and in many editions these two lines stand between stanzas 33 and
34. The change here made follows Bugge. The manuscript indicates no gap between stanzas
27 and 29. <i>Hvethna</i>: wife of King Halfdan of Denmark.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> The manuscript and many editions include line 1 of stanza 25 after line 4 of stanza
29. The story of <i>Harald Battle-tooth</i> is told in detail by Saxo Grammaticus. Harald’s father was <i>Hrörek</i>, king of Denmark; his mother was <i>Auth</i>, daughter of <i>Ivar</i>, king of Sweden. After Ivar had treacherously <span class="corr" title="Source: detroyed" id="xd32e16423">destroyed</span> Hrörek, Auth fled with Harald to Russia, where she married King <i>Rathbarth</i>. Harald’s warlike career in Norway, and his death on the Bravalla-field at the hands
of his nephew, Sigurth Ring, son of <i>Randver</i> and grandson of Rathbarth and Auth, were favorite saga themes.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> At this point begins the fragmentary and interpolated “short <i>Voluspo</i>” identified by Snorri. The manuscript gives no indication of the break in the poem’s
continuity. <i>Eleven</i>: there <span class="pageNum" id="pb228a">[<a href="#pb228a" class="pginternal">228</a>]</span>are various references to the “twelve” gods (including Baldr); Snorri (<i>Gylfaginning</i>, 20–33) lists the following twelve in addition to Othin: Thor, Baldr, Njorth, Freyr,
Tyr, Bragi, Heimdall, Hoth, Vithar, Vali, Ull and Forseti; he adds Loki as of doubtful
divinity. <i>Baldr</i> and <i>Vali</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 32–33.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> The fragmentary stanzas 31–34 have been regrouped in various ways, and with many
conjectures as to omissions, none of which are indicated in the manuscript. The order
here is as in the manuscript, except that lines 1–2 of stanza 28 have been transposed
from after line 2 of stanza 33. <i>Bur’s heir</i>: <i>Othin</i>; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 4.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Freyr, Gerth, Gymir</i>: cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>. <i>Aurbotha</i>: a giantess, mother of Gerth. <i>Thjazi</i> and <i>Skathi</i>: cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 49, and <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 19.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 44 and 27.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Heith</i> (“Witch”) and <i>Hrossthjof</i> (“Horse-thief”): the only other reference to the giant <i>Hrimnir</i> (<i>Skirnismol</i>, 28) makes no mention of his children.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb229a">[<a href="#pb229a" class="pginternal">229</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> This stanza is quoted by Snorri (<i>Gylfaginning</i>, 5). Of <i>Vitholf</i> (“Forest Wolf”), <i>Vilmeith</i> (“Wish-Tree”) and <i>Svarthofthi</i> (“Black Head”) nothing further is known. <i>Ymir</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 3.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> According to Snorri (<i>Gylfaginning</i>, 27) Heimdall was the son of Othin and of nine sisters. As Heimdall was the watchman
of the gods, this has given rise to much “solar myth” discussion. The names of his
nine giantess mothers are frequently said to denote attributes of the sea.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> The names of Heimdall’s mothers may be rendered “Yelper,” “Griper,” “Foamer,” “Sand-Strewer,”
“She-Wolf,” “Sorrow-Whelmer,” “Dusk,” “Fury,” and “Iron-Sword.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb230a">[<a href="#pb230a" class="pginternal">230</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> It has been suggested that these lines were interpolated from <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> II, 22. Some editors add the refrain of stanza 36. <i>Swine’s blood</i>: to Heimdall’s strength drawn from earth and sea was added that derived from sacrifice.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza stands after stanza 44. Regarding Heimdall’s kinship
to the three great classes of men, cf. <i>Rigsthula</i>, introductory note, wherein the apparent confusion of his attributes with those of
Othin is discussed.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Probably a lacuna before this stanza. Regarding the <i>wolf</i> Fenrir, born of <i>Loki</i> and the giantess <i>Angrbotha</i>, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 39 and note. <i>Sleipnir</i>: Othin’s eight-legged horse, born of the stallion <i>Svathilfari</i> and of Loki in the guise of a mare (cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44). <i>The worst</i>: doubtless referring to Mithgarthsorm, another child of Loki. <i>The brother of Byleist</i>: Loki; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 51.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb231a">[<a href="#pb231a" class="pginternal">231</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.13.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> Nothing further is known of the myth here referred to, wherein Loki (Lopt) eats the
cooked heart of a woman and thus himself gives birth to a monster. The reference is
not likely to be to the serpent, as, according to Snorri (<i>Gylfaginning</i>, 34), the wolf, the serpent, and Hel were all the children of Loki and Angrbotha.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Probably an omission, perhaps of considerable length, before this stanza. For the
description of the destruction of the world, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 57.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> Cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 65, where the possible reference to Christianity is noted. With this stanza the
fragmentary “short <i>Voluspo</i>” ends, and the dialogue between Freyja and Hyndla continues.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> Freyja now admits the identity of her boar as Ottar, who <span class="pageNum" id="pb232a">[<a href="#pb232a" class="pginternal">232</a>]</span>with the help of the “memory-beer” is to recall the entire genealogy he has just heard,
and thus win his wager with Angantyr.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> <i>Heithrun</i>: the she-goat that stands by Valhall (cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 25), the name being here used simply of she-goats in general, in caustic comment
on Freyja’s morals. Of these Loki entertained a similar view; cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 30.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> <i>Oth</i>: cf. stanza 6 and note, and <i>Voluspo</i>, 25 and note. Lines 3–4, abbreviated in the manuscript, are very likely repeated
here by mistake.
</p>
<p id="n1.13.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.13.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> The manuscript repeats once again lines 3–4 of stanza 47 as the last two lines of
this stanza. It seems probable that two lines have been lost, to the effect that Freyja
will burn the giantess alive “If swiftly now   |   thou dost not seek, / And hither
bring   |   the memory-beer.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two poems, <i>Grougaldr</i> (<i>Groa’s Spell</i>) and <i>Fjolsvinnsmol</i> (the <i>Ballad of Fjolsvith</i>), which many editors have, very wisely, united under the single title of <i>Svipdagsmol</i>, are found only in paper manuscripts, none of them antedating the seventeenth century.
Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of
“kennings” or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the
character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them
in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact
that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether
or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is
an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well
known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief
prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue
and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the <i>Grimnismol</i>, in connection with the use of prose links.
</p>
<p>The love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag’s mother,
is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with
her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero’s winning
of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild
traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends
entirely on one’s view of the whole “solar myth” school of criticism, not so highly
esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain
what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with
dramatic effectiveness.
</p>
<p>In later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North,
and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads.
These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative
surrounding the dialogue poems here given.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n1.14.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Svipdag</i> (“Swift Day”): the names of the speakers are lacking in the manuscripts.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>The woman</i>: Svipdag’s stepmother, who is responsible for <span class="pageNum" id="pb236a">[<a href="#pb236a" class="pginternal">236</a>]</span>his search for <i>Mengloth</i> (“Necklace-Glad”). This name has suggested that Mengloth is really <i>Frigg</i>, possessor of the famous Brisings’ necklace, or else Freyja (cf. <i>Lokasenna</i>, 20, note).
</p>
<p id="n1.14.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> For this catalogue of charms (stanzas 6–14) cf. the <i>Ljothatal</i> (<i>Hovamol</i>, 147–165). <i>Rani</i> and <i>Rind</i>: the manuscripts have these words in inverse relation; I have followed Neckel’s emendation.
Rind was the giantess who became the mother of Vali, Othin’s son, the one-night-old
avenger of Baldr (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 33–34, and <i>Baldrs Draumar</i>, 11 and note). Rani is presumably Othin, who, according to a skaldic poem, won Rind
by magic.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Urth</i>: one of the three Norns, or Fates; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 20.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb237a">[<a href="#pb237a" class="pginternal">237</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Horn</i> and <i>Ruth</i>: these two rivers, here used merely to symbolize all dangerous streams, are not included
in the catalogue of rivers given in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 27–29, for which reason some editors have changed the names to Hron and Hrith.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> This stanza is a close parallel to <i>Hovamol</i>, 150, and the fifth line may well be an interpolation from line 4 of that stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238a">[<a href="#pb238a" class="pginternal">238</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>A dead Christian woman</i>: this passage has distressed many editors, who have sought to emend the text so as
to make it mean simply “a dead witch.” The fact seems to be, however, that this particular
charm was composed at a time when Christians were regarded by all conservative pagans
as emissaries of darkness. A dead woman’s curse would naturally be more potent, whether
she was Christian or otherwise, than a living one’s. Presumably this charm is much
older than the poem in which it here stands.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> At this point Groa’s song ends, and Svipdag, thus fortified, goes to seek Mengloth.
All the link that is needed between the poems is approximately this: “Then Svipdag
searched long for <span class="pageNum" id="pb239a">[<a href="#pb239a" class="pginternal">239</a>]</span>Mengloth, and at last he came to a great house set all about with flames. And before
the house there was a giant.”
</p>
<p id="n1.14.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> Most editors have here begun a new series of stanza numbers, but if the <i>Grougaldr</i> and the <i>Fjolsvinnsmol</i> are to be considered as a single poem, it seems more reasonable to continue the stanza
numbers consecutively. Bugge thinks a stanza has been lost before 17, including Fjolsvith’s
name, so that the “he” in line 1 might have something to refer to. However, just such
a prose link as I have suggested in the note on stanza 16 would serve the purpose.
Editors have suggested various rearrangements in the lines of stanzas 17–19. The substance,
however, is clear enough. The giant <i>Fjolsvith</i> (“Much-Wise”), the warder of the house in which Mengloth dwells, sees Svipdag coming
and stops him with the customary threats. The assignment of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb240a">[<a href="#pb240a" class="pginternal">240</a>]</span>speeches in stanzas 17–20, in the absence of any indications in the manuscripts, is
more or less guesswork.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Vindkald</i> (“Wind-Cold”), <i>Varkald</i> (“Cold of Early Spring”) and <i>Fjolkald</i> (“Much Cold”): Svipdag apparently seeks to persuade Fjolsvith that he belongs to
the frost giants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb241a">[<a href="#pb241a" class="pginternal">241</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Svafrthorin</i>: who he was, or what his name means, or who his son was, are all unknown.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Thrymgjol</i> (“Loud-Clanging”): this gate, like the gate of the dead, shuts so fast as to trap
those who attempt to use it (cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 68 and note). It was made by the dwarfs, sons of <i>Solblindi</i> (“Sun-Blinded”), the traditional craftsmen, who could not endure the light of day.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb242a">[<a href="#pb242a" class="pginternal">242</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Gastropnir</i>: “Guest-Crusher.” <i>Leirbrimir’s</i> (“Clay-Giant’s”) <i>limbs</i>: a poetic circumlocution for “clay”; cf. the description of the making of earth from
the body of the giant Ymir, <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 21.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> <i>Mimameith</i> (“Mimir’s Tree”): the ash Yggdrasil, that overshadows the whole world. The well of
Mimir was situated at its base; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 27–29.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb243a">[<a href="#pb243a" class="pginternal">243</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> Gering suggests that two stanzas have been lost between stanzas 15 and 16, but the
giant’s answer fits the question quite well enough. The fruit of Yggdrasil, when cooked,
is here assumed to have the power of assuring safe childbirth.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Vithofnir</i> (“Tree-Snake”): apparently identical with either the cock Gollinkambi (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 43) or Fjalar (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 42), the former of which wakes the gods to battle, and the latter the giants. <i>Surt</i>: the giant mentioned in <i>Voluspo</i>, 52, as ruler of the fire-world; here used to represent the giants in general, who
are constantly in terror of the cock’s eternal watchfulness. <i>Sinmora</i>: presumably Surt’s wife, the giantess who possesses the weapon by which alone the
cock Vithofnir may be slain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244a">[<a href="#pb244a" class="pginternal">244</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> The last two lines have been variously emended.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>Gif</i> and <i>Geri</i>: both names signify “Greedy.” The first part of line 3 is conjectural; the manuscripts
indicate the word “eleven,” which clearly fails to make sense.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb245a">[<a href="#pb245a" class="pginternal">245</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> <i>Lævatein</i> (“Wounding Wand”): the manuscripts differ as to the form of this name. The suggestion
that the reference is to the mistletoe with which Baldr was killed seems hardly reasonable.
<i>Lopt</i>: Loki. <i>Lægjarn</i> (“Lover of Ill”): Loki; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 35, <span class="pageNum" id="pb246a">[<a href="#pb246a" class="pginternal">246</a>]</span>where the term appears as an adjective applied to Loki. This is Falk’s emendation
for the manuscripts’ “Sægjarn,” meaning “Sea Lover.” <i>Sinmora</i>: cf. stanza 34.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.44" class="pginternal">44</a><span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd32e17912">.</span></span> <i>Goddess of gold</i>: poetic circumlocution for “woman,” here meaning Sinmora.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> <i>Sickle</i>: i.e., tail feather. With this the circle of impossibilities is completed. To get
past the dogs, they must be fed with the wing-joints of the cock Vithofnir; the cock
can be killed only <span class="pageNum" id="pb247a">[<a href="#pb247a" class="pginternal">247</a>]</span>with the sword in Sinmora’s possession, and Sinmora will give up the sword only in
return for the tail feather of the cock.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> <i>Lyr</i> (“Heat-Holding”): just what the spear-point reference means is not altogether clear.
Presumably it refers to the way in which the glowing brightness of the lofty hall
makes it seem to quiver and turn in the air, but the tradition, never baffled by physical
laws, may have actually balanced the whole building on a single point to add to the
difficulties of entrance.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> <i>Loki</i>, the one god named, was the builder of the hall, with the aid of the nine dwarfs.
<i>Jari</i>, <i>Dori</i>, and <i>Ori</i> appear in the <i>Voluspo</i> catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 13 and 15); <i>Delling</i> appears in <i>Hovamol</i>, 161, and <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 25, in the latter case, however, the name quite possibly referring to some one else.
The other dwarfs’ names do not appear elsewhere. The manuscripts differ as to the
forms of many of these names.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb248a">[<a href="#pb248a" class="pginternal">248</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.52"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.52" class="pginternal">52</a>.</span> <i>Lyfjaberg</i> (“Hill of Healing”): the manuscripts vary as to this name; I have followed Bugge’s
suggestion. This stanza implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence,
perhaps, an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name (cf. stanza 3, note).
In stanza 54 Eir appears as one of Mengloth’s handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri
(<i>Gylfaginning</i>, 35) is herself the Norse Hygeia. Compare this stanza with stanza 32.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> The manuscripts and editions show many variations in these names. They may be approximately
rendered thus: Helper, Help-Breather, Folk-Guardian, Shining, White, Blithe, Peaceful,
Kindly (?), and Gold-Giver.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb249a">[<a href="#pb249a" class="pginternal">249</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.55"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.55" class="pginternal">55</a>.</span> One of the manuscripts omits stanzas 55 and 56.
</p>
<p id="n1.14.56"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.56" class="pginternal">56</a>.</span> The first line is based on a conjectural emendation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb250a">[<a href="#pb250a" class="pginternal">250</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.63"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.63" class="pginternal">63</a>.</span> <i>Solbjart</i> (“Sun-Bright”): not elsewhere mentioned. <i>The words of Urth</i>: i.e., the decrees of fate; cf. stanza 7.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb251a">[<a href="#pb251a" class="pginternal">251</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n1.14.65"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg1.14.65" class="pginternal">65</a>.</span> <i>Lyfjaberg</i> cf. stanza 52 and note.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Between the <i>Thrymskvitha</i> and the <i>Alvissmol</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> stands the <i>Völundarkvitha</i>. It was also included in the <i>Arnamagnæan Codex</i>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved,
and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain. This is doubly regrettable
because the text in <i>Regius</i> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have
been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.
</p>
<p>There has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing
particularly the relations between the <i>Völundarkvitha</i> and the Weland passage in <i>Deor’s Lament</i>. There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions,
along with many of the other early hero tales. In stanza 16 the Rhine is specifically
mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry
probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that
the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia. In one form or another,
however, the legend or the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic
lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and
even of Rudyard Kipling’s tales of England.
</p>
<p>In what form this story reached the North is uncertain. Sundry striking parallels
between the diction of the <i>Völundarkvitha</i> and that of the Weland passage in <i>Deor’s Lament</i> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to
Scandinavia or Iceland. But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the “old sagas”
in which Völund was celebrated, and in the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of
the <i>Velentssaga</i> (Velent, Völund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives
a long story for which the <i>Völundarkvitha</i> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material. It is probable, then,
that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as
the latter part of the ninth century.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253" class="pginternal">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of
the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly. Doubtless there
were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many
of them with very little if any traditional authority. The main one, however, the
story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland’s
terrible revenge, forms the basis of the <i>Völundarkvitha</i>. To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of Völund and the swan-maiden,
who, to make things even more complex, is likewise said to be a Valkyrie. Some critics
maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung
together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a
whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet—for linguistically
the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection—used two distinct legends,
whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous
poem.
</p>
<p>The swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland
tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German <span class="corr" title="Source: folk tales" id="xd32e18066">folk-tales</span>. Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin,
and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place
before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt
to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.
</p>
<p>The <i>Völundarkvitha</i> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction. The nature of such prose
links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the <i>Grimnismol</i>; the <i>Völundarkvitha</i> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic
verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being
provided, if at all, in prose. This prose was put in by each reciter according to
his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers’ need for such explanations;
some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.
</p>
<p>The manuscript of the <i>Völundarkvitha</i> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that
in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.</p>

<p class="first" id="prose2.1">There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name
was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called
Slagfith, another Egil, the third Völund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts.
They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake
there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake
three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan-garments, for they
were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White
and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These
did they bring <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255" class="pginternal">255</a>]</span>home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and Völund
All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles,
and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith
followed Swan-White, but Völund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as
men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.1" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Nithuth</i> (“Bitter Hater”): here identified as a king of Sweden, is in the poem (stanzas 9,
15 and 32) called lord of the Njars, which may refer to the people of the Swedish
district of Nerike. In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands
into the Northeast. The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the
second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode. <i>Bothvild</i> (“Warlike Maid”): Völund’s victim in the latter part of the poem. <i>King of the Finns</i>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls Völund an elf, may perhaps
be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction. The Finns, meaning
the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers. <i>Egil</i> appears in the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> as Völund’s brother, but <i>Slagfith</i> is not elsewhere mentioned. <i>Ulfdalir</i> (“Wolf-Dale”), <i>Ulfsjar</i> (“Wolf-Sea”), <i>Valland</i> (“Slaughter-Land”): mythical places without historical identification. <i>Valkyries</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31 and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan-maidens as
Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza 1 and again in line 5 of stanza
5, which may mean, as Gering translates it, “helmed,” or else “fair and wise.” I suspect
that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color
as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that <span class="pageNum" id="pb255a">[<a href="#pb255a" class="pginternal">255</a>]</span>the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all. However, this identification
of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, 7. The three maidens’ names, <i>Hlathguth</i>, <i>Hervor</i>, and <i>Olrun</i>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries. <i>King Hlothver</i>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form
of Ludwig; the name appears again in <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> II, 26, and that of <i>Kjar</i> is found in <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 7, both of these poems being based on German stories. It is worth noting that the
composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond
what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the
“old stories” about Völund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else
he thought it needless to make use of them. His note simply puts in clear and connected
form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth
a king of Sweden and Völund’s father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar
for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in
Valland.

<p id="n2.1.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> The phrase “Völund home from a weary way” is an emendation of Bugge’s, accepted by
many editors. Some of those who do not include it reject line 4, and combine the remainder
of the stanza with all or part of stanza 7.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> The manuscript marks the second, and not the first, line as the beginning of a stanza.
Some editors combine lines 2–3 with all or part of stanza 8. No gap is indicated in
the manuscript, but many editors have assumed one, some of them accepting Bugge’s
suggested “Till back the maiden   |   bright should come.”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> No line in this stanza is indicated in the manuscript as beginning a new stanza;
editors have tried all sorts of experiments in regrouping the lines into stanzas with
those of stanzas 7 and 9. In line 3 the word <i>long</i> is sheer guesswork, as the line in the manuscript contains a metrical error.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> Some editors combine the first two lines with parts of stanza 8, and the last two
with the first half of stanza 10. <i>Njars</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb258a">[<a href="#pb258a" class="pginternal">258</a>]</span>there has been much, and inconclusive, discussion as to what this name means; probably
it applies to a semi-mythical people somewhere vaguely in “the East.”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Some editors combine lines 3–4 with the fragmentary stanza 11.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine these lines with lines 3–4
of stanza 10, while others combine them with the first two lines of stanza 12. The
one ring which Nithuth’s men steal is given to Bothvild, and proves the cause of her
undoing.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3, and not line 1, as the beginning of a stanza, which
has given rise to a large amount of conjectural rearrangement. Line 2 of the original
is identical with the phrase added by Bugge in stanza 6. Line 5 may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb259a">[<a href="#pb259a" class="pginternal">259</a>]</span>spurious, or lines 4–5 may have been expanded out of a single line running “The wind-dried
wood   |   for Völund burned well.”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Elves</i>: the poem here identifies Völund as belonging to the race of the elves. <i>Hlothver’s daughter</i>: Hervor; many editors treat the adjective “all-wise” here as a proper name.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> In this poem the manuscript indicates the speakers. Some editors make lines 1–2 into
a separate stanza, linking lines 3–5 (or 4–5) with stanza 16. Line 3 is very possibly
spurious, a mere expansion of “Nithuth spake.” Nithuth, of course, has come with his
men to capture Völund, and now charges him with having stolen his treasure.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> The manuscript definitely assigns this stanza to Völund, but many editors give the
first two lines to Nithuth. In the manuscript <span class="pageNum" id="pb260a">[<a href="#pb260a" class="pginternal">260</a>]</span>stanza 16 is followed by the two lines of stanza 2, and many editions make of lines
3–4 of stanza 16 and stanza 2 a single speech by Völund. <i>Grani’s way</i>: Grani was Sigurth’s horse, on which he rode to slay Fafnir and win Andvari’s hoard;
this and the reference to the <i>Rhine</i> as the home of wealth betray the southern source of the story. If lines 1–2 belong
to Völund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that Völund’s
hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that Völund
presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine,
so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> Line 1 is lacking in the manuscript, lines 2–4 following immediately after the two
lines here given as stanza 2. Line 1, borrowed from line 1 of stanza 32, is placed
here by many editors, following Bugge’s suggestion. Certainly it is Nithuth’s wife
who utters line 4. <i>Who comes from the wood</i>: Völund, noted as a hunter. Gering assumes that with the entrance of Nithuth’s wife
the scene has changed from Völund’s house to Nithuth’s, but I cannot see that this
is necessary.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.1.17" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The annotator inserted this note rather clumsily in the midst of the speech of Nithuth’s
wife.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb261a">[<a href="#pb261a" class="pginternal">261</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.1.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> In the manuscript lines 2–3 stand before line 1; many editors have made the transposition
here indicated. Some editors reject line 3 as spurious. <i>Sævarstath</i>: “Sea-Stead.”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> This stanza is obviously in bad shape. Vigfusson makes two stanzas of it by adding
a first line: “Then did Völund speak,   |   sagest of elves.” Editors have rejected
various lines, and some have regrouped the last lines with the first two of <span class="pageNum" id="pb262a">[<a href="#pb262a" class="pginternal">262</a>]</span>stanza 20. The elimination of the passages in parenthesis produces a four-line stanza
which is metrically correct, but it has little more than guesswork to support it.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The editions vary radically in combining the lines of this stanza with those of stanzas
19 and 21, particularly as the manuscript indicates the third line as the beginning
of a stanza. The meaning, however, remains unchanged.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> Several editions make one stanza out of lines 3–4 of stanza 20 and lines 1–2 of stanza
21, and another out of the next four lines. <i>The evil was open</i>: i.e., the gold in the chest was destined to be their undoing.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and several editors
have adopted this grouping. In the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> Völund sends the boys away with instructions not to come back until just after a
fall of snow, and then to approach his dwelling walking backward. The boys do this,
and when, after he has killed them, Völund is questioned regarding them, he points
to the tracks in the snow as evidence that they had left his house.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb263a">[<a href="#pb263a" class="pginternal">263</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.1.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript. Some editors assume it, as here; some group the
lines with lines 3–4 of stanza 22, and some with lines 1–2 of stanza 24.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> Some editions begin a new stanza with line 3.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editors have
adopted this grouping.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> These two lines have been grouped in various ways, either with lines 3–4 of stanza
25 or with the fragmentary stanza 27. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, but the
loss of something is so obvious that practically all editors have noted it, although
they have differed as to the number of lines lost.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; the line and a half <span class="pageNum" id="pb264a">[<a href="#pb264a" class="pginternal">264</a>]</span>might be filled out (partly with the aid of late paper manuscripts) thus: “But soon
it broke,   |   and swiftly to Völund / She bore it and said—”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name Völund as the speaker before line 3; Vigfusson again
inserts his convenient line, “Then Völund spake,   |   sagest of elves.” A few editions
combine lines 3–4 with the two lines of stanza 30.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the two lines with lines
3–4 of stanza 29, and many with the three lines of stanza 31.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb265a">[<a href="#pb265a" class="pginternal">265</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.1.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> Something has probably been lost before this stanza, explaining how Völund made himself
wings, as otherwise, owing to his lameness, he could not leave the island. The <i>Thithrekssaga</i> tells the story of how Völund’s brother, Egil, shot birds and gave him the feathers,
out of which he made a feather-garment. This break in the narrative illustrates the
lack of knowledge apparently possessed by the compiler who was responsible for the
prose notes; had he known the story told in the <i>Thithrekssaga</i>, it is hardly conceivable that he would have failed to indicate the necessary connecting
link at this point. Some editors reject line 3 as spurious. The manuscript does not
indicate any lacuna.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editors have
followed this arrangement.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. It indicates line 3 as the beginning of
a new stanza. Vigfusson adds before line 1, “Then spake Nithuth,   |   lord of the
Njars.”
</p>
<p id="n2.1.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript, but it seems clear <span class="pageNum" id="pb266a">[<a href="#pb266a" class="pginternal">266</a>]</span>that something has been lost. Some editors combine these two lines with lines 3–4
of stanza 33. Völund is now flying over Nithuth’s hall.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker; Vigfusson again makes two full stanzas
with the line, “Then did Völund speak,   |   sagest of elves.” Some editors begin
a new stanza with line 4, while others reject as interpolations lines 2–3 or 5–7.
<i>Völund’s wife</i>: the reference is to Bothvild, as Völund wishes to have his vengeance fall more heavily
on her father than on her.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Lines 3–4 are nearly identical with lines 3–4 of stanza 24.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Identical, except for the pronouns, with stanza 25.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267a">[<a href="#pb267a" class="pginternal">267</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.1.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> Lines 1–2: cf. stanza 26.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. Either line 4 or line 5 may be an interpolation;
two editions reject lines 3–5, combining lines 1–2 with stanza 40. In the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> Nithuth actually compels Egil, Völund’s brother, to shoot at Völund. The latter has
concealed a bladder full of blood under his left arm, and when his brother’s arrow
pierces this, Nithuth assumes that his enemy has been killed. This episode likewise
appears among the scenes from Völund’s career rudely carved on an ancient casket of
ivory, bearing an Anglo-Saxon inscription in runic letters, which has been preserved.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> Line 1: cf. stanza 31. The manuscript indicates no lacuna.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb268a">[<a href="#pb268a" class="pginternal">268</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.1.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> The first line is a conjectural addition. <i>Thakkrath</i> is probably the northern form of the Middle High German name Dancrat.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, but indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza;
Vigfusson’s added “Then Nithuth spake,   |   lord of the Njars” seems plausible enough.
</p>
<p id="n2.1.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.1.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. Different editors have rejected one or
another of the last three lines, and as the manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning
of a new stanza, the loss of two or three lines has likewise been suggested. According
to the <i>Thithrekssaga</i>, the son of Völund and Bothvild was Vithga, or Witege, one of the heroes of Dietrich
of Bern.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The three Helgi lays, all found in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, have been the subjects of a vast amount of discussion, in spite of which many of
the facts regarding them are still very far from settled. It is, indeed, scarcely
possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a
flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction.
The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship,
date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their
original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many
other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among
students of the <i>Edda’s</i> history.
</p>
<p>Without attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should
be noted. Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of
King Halfdan. Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity,
and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be
pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic.
The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd,
the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.
</p>
<p>From Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into
the Norse settlements among the islands. Not many of its original features remained,
and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi’s love affair
with Sigrun. The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained,
and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were
fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.
</p>
<p>How the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question.
Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is
not unnatural <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270" class="pginternal">270</a>]</span>that some confusion should have arisen. At no time, however, was the connection particularly
close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned. In the two
lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that
Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay
of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all. On the other hand, Helgi
does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories,
although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, introductory note) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons.
In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love
affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course
of the narrative. Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson
and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter
being the daughter of King Eylimi. Still another son, who complicates both stories
somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy. Sinfjotli appears
in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note).
</p>
<p>There is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and
that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose
notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie. Whether this resemblance was the cause of
bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund’s
son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined.
</p>
<p>The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat
distant cousin of the other two. The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional
figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is
no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun. At the same
time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such
as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back. The annotator brings
the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi “born again,” and not
once only, but twice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271" class="pginternal">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first Helgi lay is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct
poems, differentiated not only by subject-matter but by metrical form. Although the
question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas 1–11 and 31–43) seems in
turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems. The first
five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth’s followers,
concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth’s wife and Helgi’s
mother. Stanzas 6–11 are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying
prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse
to prove this). Stanzas 12–30 form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard
over Helgi’s ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this
section has sometimes been called the <i>Hrimgertharmol</i> (<i>Lay of Hrimgerth</i>). The last section, stanzas 31–43, is again fairly consecutive, and tells of the
death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.
</p>
<p>Parts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite
impossible to tell surely. All of them are generally dated by commentators not later
than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the <i>Hrimgertharmol</i> (section III) is placed considerably later. When and by whom these fragments were
pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the
prose notes and links, of which the <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i> has a larger amount than any other poem in the <i>Edda</i>. These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost
exclusively dialogue. Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying
to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work
pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions. Bugge has advanced the
theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part
of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.
</p>
<p>It seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark
through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven,
although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of
the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at
different times and in different places, <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272" class="pginternal">272</a>]</span>reflecting varied forms of the story. Many generations afterwards, when Iceland’s
literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or
fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis
of information which had reached him through other channels. The prose notes to <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (13–16) is introduced
with the phrase, “as is said in the Old Volsung Lay”; the final prose note cites an
incident “told in the <i>Karuljoth</i> (<i>Lay of Kara</i>),” and a two-line speech is quoted “as it was written before in the <i>Helgakvitha</i>.”
</p>
<p class="tb"/><p>
</p>
<p>The whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed
in great detail by Bugge in his <i lang="no">Helge-Digtene i den Ældre Edda, Deres Hjem og Forbindelser</i>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title <i>The Home of the Eddic Poems</i>, is available for readers of English. This study is exceedingly valuable, if not
in all respects convincing. The whole matter is so complex and so important in the
history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is
so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down
to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of
a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.</p>

</p>
<p>OF HJORVARTH AND SIGRLIN
</p>
<p>Hjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and
their son was named Hethin; the second was called Særeith, and their son was named
Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273" class="pginternal">273</a>]</span>named Hymling. King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman
he knew was fairest. He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others,
whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called
Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with
King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin’s foster-father; his daughter
was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden’s hand was denied, and Atli went
home. Atli, the jarl’s son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches
up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth’s wives the fairest of
women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.2" class="pginternal">Prose</a></i>: In the manuscript the sub-title, “Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin,” stands as the title
for the whole poem, though it clearly applies only to the first five stanzas. Most
editions employ the title here given. <i>Hjorvarth</i>: the name is a not uncommon one; <span class="pageNum" id="pb273a">[<a href="#pb273a" class="pginternal">273</a>]</span>there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical-heroic genealogies of the
<i>Hyndluljoth</i> (stanzas 23 and 28), and Hjorvarth appears in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I (stanza 14) and II (prose after stanza 12) as a son of Hunding. This particular
Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of
Norway. The name means “Sword-Guardian.” <i>Four wives</i>: polygamy, while very infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas. <i>Alfhild</i>: “Elf-Warrior.” <i>Hethin</i>: “Fur-Clothed” (?). <i>Særeith</i>: “Sea-Rider.” <i>Sinrjoth</i>: “Ever-Red.” The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin. It has been suggested
that Særeith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as
also <i>Humlung</i> and <i>Hymling</i>, their sons. <i>Svafnir</i>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which
could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea. <i>Sigrlin</i>: “The Conquering Serpent.” <i>Atli</i>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel). <i>Alof</i>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf. <i>A bird</i>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (<i>Fafnismol</i>, stanzas 32–38). This is one of the many curious resemblances between the Helgi and
the Sigurth stories.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb274a">[<a href="#pb274a" class="pginternal">274</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Glasir’s wood</i>: Snorri in the <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> quotes a half stanza to the effect that “Glasir stands with golden leaves before
Othin’s hall,” and calls it “the fairest wood among gods and men.” The phrase as used
here seems to mean little.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> The bird’s demands would indicate that it is in reality one of the gods. <i>Gold-horned cattle</i>: cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 23. There <span class="pageNum" id="pb275a">[<a href="#pb275a" class="pginternal">275</a>]</span>are other references to gilding the horns of cattle, particularly for sacrificial
purposes.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.4" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The annotator contradicts himself here, as he had already stated that Atli was on
his way home.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Possibly the remains of two stanzas, or perhaps a line has been added. <i>Sæmorn</i>: this river is nowhere else mentioned.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.5" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Sigrlin and Alof, protected by the latter’s father, Franmar, have fled before the
ravaging army of Sigrlin’s rejected <span class="pageNum" id="pb276a">[<a href="#pb276a" class="pginternal">276</a>]</span>suitor, Hrothmar. The beginning of a new section (II) is indicated in the manuscript
only by the unusually large capital letter with which “Hjorvarth” begins. <i>No name</i>, etc.: this probably means that Helgi had always been so silent that he would answer
to no name, with the result that he had none. <i>Valkyries</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31 and note. The annotator insists here and in the prose after stanza 9 that Svava
was a Valkyrie, but there is nothing in the verse to prove it, or, indeed, to identify
the Svava of the last section of the poem with the person who gave Helgi his name.
In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Sigmund himself names his son Helgi, and gives him a sword, following <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Battle-tree</i>: poetic phrase for “warrior.” <i>Shining fields</i>: the words in the manuscript may form a proper name, Rothulsvoll, having this meaning.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Gift</i>: not only was it customary to give gifts with the naming <span class="pageNum" id="pb277a">[<a href="#pb277a" class="pginternal">277</a>]</span>of a child, but the practice frequently obtained when a permanent epithet was added
to the name of an adult.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Sigarsholm</i> (“Isle of Sigar”): a place not identified, but probably related to the Sigarsvoll
where Helgi was slain (stanza 35).
</p>
<p id="n2.2.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The sword is carved with magic runes and with snakes. <i>Fame</i>: the original word is uncertain.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.9" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Eylimi</i>: this name is another link with the Sigurth story, as it is likewise the name of
the father of Sigurth’s mother, Hjordis.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> With this stanza begins a new episode, that of Helgi’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb278a">[<a href="#pb278a" class="pginternal">278</a>]</span>victory over King Hrothmar, who had killed his mother’s father (cf. prose after stanza
5). It has been suggested, in consequence, that stanzas 10–11 may be a separate fragment.
The verse tells nothing of the battle, merely giving Helgi’s reproaches to his father
for having left Svafnir’s death and the burning of Svavaland unavenged.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.11" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript does not indicate any break, but the episode which forms the basis
of the <i>Hrimgertharmol</i> (stanzas 12–30) clearly begins with the slaying of the giant Hati (“The Hateful”).
<i>Hatafjord</i>: “Hati’s Fjord.” <i>Hrimgerth</i>: “Frost-Shrouded” (?).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb279a">[<a href="#pb279a" class="pginternal">279</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Iron</i>: the keels of Norse ships were sometimes fitted with iron “shoes” at bow and stern,
but it is not certain that this practice much antedated the year 1000, and thus this
line has raised some question as to the antiquity of this stanza, if not of the entire
<i>Hrimgertharmol</i>, which may have been composed as late as the eleventh century.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. The pun on “Atli” and “atall” (meaning
“ill”) is untranslatable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb280a">[<a href="#pb280a" class="pginternal">280</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> From this point to the end the manuscript does not indicate the speakers. <i>Ron</i>: wife of the sea-god Ægir, who draws drowning men into the sea with her net. There
is no other reference to the wounding of Hrimgerth.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> Apparently both Hrimgerth and her mother, Hati’s wife, had sought to destroy Helgi’s
ships, and had actually killed some of his companions, the sons of <i>Hlothvarth</i>, concerning whom nothing more is known. Many editors assume that a stanza containing
a speech by Atli has been lost after stanza 19.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb281a">[<a href="#pb281a" class="pginternal">281</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Apparently Hrimgerth has assumed the form of a mare.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Varin’s cove</i>: the name of Varin appears twice in place names in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i> (stanzas 27 and 39). The sagas mention a mythical King Varin who lived at Skorustrond
in Rogaland (Norway).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb282a">[<a href="#pb282a" class="pginternal">282</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> Of the giant <i>Lothin</i> (“The Shaggy”) and his home in <i>Tholley</i> (“Pine Island”) nothing is known. Cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, 35.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> Something is clearly wrong with this stanza, and the manuscript indicates line 6
as the beginning of a new one. Perhaps a line (between lines 4 and 5) has been lost,
or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are interpolations. Hrimgerth here refers to Svava,
or to the protectress with whom the annotator has identified her, as having saved
Helgi and his ships from the vengeance of the giantesses. In the original line 1 includes
Helgi’s name, which makes it metrically incorrect.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb283a">[<a href="#pb283a" class="pginternal">283</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Again something is clearly wrong, and the last three lines look like interpolations,
though some editors have tried to reconstruct two full stanzas. The passage suggests
the identification of the Valkyries with the clouds.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> Some editions give this speech to Helgi. <i>Eastward</i>: Atli and Helgi have held Hrimgerth in talk till sunrise, and the sun’s rays turn
her into stone. But dwarfs rather than giants were the victims of sunlight; cf. <i>Alvissmol</i>, stanzas 16 and 35.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb284a">[<a href="#pb284a" class="pginternal">284</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Most editions give this stanza to Atli. With this the <i>Hrimgertharmol</i> ends, and after the next prose passage the meter reverts to that of the earlier sections.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.30" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript does not indicate a new section of the poem. <i>Eylimi</i>: cf. note on prose after stanza 9. <i>Valkyrie</i>: here, as before, the annotator has apparently nothing but his own imagination on
which to base his statement. Svava in the ensuing stanzas certainly does not behave
like a Valkyrie. <i>Norway</i>: the annotator doubtless based this statement on the reference to Norway in line
2 of stanza 31. <i>Yule-eve</i>: the Yule feast, marking the new year, was a great event in the heathen North. It
was a time of feasting and merrymaking, vows (“New Year’s resolutions”), ghosts and
witches; the spirits had their greatest power on Yule-eve. <i>The king’s toast</i>: vows made at the passing of the king’s cup at the Yule feast were particularly sacred.
<i>Sacred boar</i>: a boar consecrated to Freyr, an integral part of the Yule rites. Hethin’s vow, which
is, of course, the vengeance of the troll-woman, is too sacred to be broken, but he
immediately realizes the horror of his oath.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb285a">[<a href="#pb285a" class="pginternal">285</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> <i>From Norway</i>: Bugge uses this phrase as evidence that the poem was composed in one of the Icelandic
settlements of the western islands, but as the annotator himself seems to have thought
that Hethin came to Helgi by land (“on wild paths southward”), this argument does
not appear to have much weight.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> The second line is conjectural; a line has clearly been lost from this stanza, and
various emendations have been suggested.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb286a">[<a href="#pb286a" class="pginternal">286</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Perhaps this is the remnant of two stanzas, or perhaps two lines (probably the ones
in parenthesis) have been interpolated. <i>The isle</i>: duels were commonly fought on islands, probably to guard against treacherous interference,
whence the usual name for a duel was “isle-going.” A duel was generally fought three
days after the challenge. Reckoning the lapse of time by nights instead of days was
a common practice throughout the German and Scandinavian peoples.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.34" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Some editors place all or part of this prose passage after stanza 35. <i>Following-spirits</i>: the “fylgja” was a female guardian spirit whose appearance generally betokened death.
The belief was common throughout the North, and has come down to recent times in Scottish
and Irish folk-lore. Individuals and sometimes whole families had these following-spirits,
but it was most unusual for a person to have more than one of them. <i>Alf</i>: son of the Hrothmar who killed Helgi’s grandfather, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb287a">[<a href="#pb287a" class="pginternal">287</a>]</span>who was in turn later killed by Helgi. <i>Sigarsvoll</i> (“Sigar’s Field”): cf. stanza 8 and note; the Sigar in question may be the man who
appears as Helgi’s messenger in stanzas 36–39.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>Sigar</i> (“The Victorious”): cf. the foregoing note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb288a">[<a href="#pb288a" class="pginternal">288</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Frekastein</i> (“Wolf-Crag”): the name appears several times in the Helgi lays applied to battlefields;
cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 46 and 55, and II, 18 and 24. <i>Need</i>: i.e., Alf deserves no credit for the victory, which was due to the troll-woman’s
magic.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289a">[<a href="#pb289a" class="pginternal">289</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.2.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> One or two editors ascribe this stanza to Hethin.
</p>
<p id="n2.2.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.2.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> A few editions make the extraordinary blunder of ascribing this speech to the dying
Helgi. The point, of course, is that Hethin will satisfy Svava’s vow by becoming famous
as the slayer of Alf. <i>Rogheim</i> (“Home of Battle”) and <i>Rothulsfjoll</i> (“Sun-Mountain”): nowhere else mentioned; Hethin means simply that he will not come
back to Svava till he has won fame.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.2.43" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Regarding this extraordinary bit see the prose note at the end of <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i>. Gering thinks the reborn Helgi Hjorvarthsson was Helgi Hundingsbane, while Svava,
according to the annotator himself, became Sigrun. The point seems to be simply that
there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable
ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times,
to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis.
Needless to say, the poems themselves know nothing of this rebirth, and we owe the
suggestion entirely to the annotator, who probably got it from current tradition.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made. The first lay of Helgi
Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed
probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents
several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative
poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for
the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another
and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact,
a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his
prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do.
The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development
in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly,
not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay
and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after
the year 1000.
</p>
<p>The first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems
by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were
the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri’s dictionary of poetic phrases
an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I
have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character
of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): “And the horse of the giantess
  |   raven’s-food had.” This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode
on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.
</p>
<p>Except for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and
there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to
the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making
Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and
his sister Signy, in a passage which has <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291" class="pginternal">291</a>]</span>little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an
expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the “old Volsung lay” to
which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza
12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the
blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately
as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and
as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50,
though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused
much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably
reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion
of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the
poet had any definite locations in mind.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n2.3.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The manuscript contains the superscription: “Here begins the lay of Helgi <span class="corr" title="Source: Hundingbane" id="xd32e20700">Hundingsbane</span> and h. (Hothbrodd?) The lay of the Volsungs.” <i>Eagles</i>, etc.: the screaming of eagles and water pouring from heaven were portents of the
birth of a hero. <i>Borghild</i>: Sigmund’s first wife; <i>Bralund</i> was her home, not Sigmund’s.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Norns</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 20 and note. Here it is the Norns who <span class="pageNum" id="pb292a">[<a href="#pb292a" class="pginternal">292</a>]</span>preside over Helgi’s early destiny, and not a Valkyrie, as in <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> Line 2 is largely guesswork, the manuscript being obscure. <i>Moon’s hall</i>: the sky.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>East</i>, etc.: the Norns give Helgi fame in the East, West, and North; in the North his renown
is particularly to endure. This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of
the Helgi story over many lands. <i>Neri’s kinswoman</i>: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may
not be a proper name at all.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after
line 2. <i>Ylfings’ son</i>: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark,
was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has
to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb293a">[<a href="#pb293a" class="pginternal">293</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Sigmund</i>: the chief link between the Helgi and Sigurth stories. He was the son of Volsung,
great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and
Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth.
An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner’s Siegmund and Sieglinde)
resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note).
</p>
<p id="n2.3.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>The king</i>: Sigmund, who gives his son a symbol of the lands which he bestows on him. Regarding
the leek, cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 4; <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> I, 17, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 7.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Hringstathir</i> (“Ring-Stead”): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the
Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition. <i>Hringstoth</i> may be another form of the same name. <i>Solfjoll</i> (“Sun-Mountain”) and <i>Snæfjoll</i> (“Snow-Mountain”) are fictitious names. Regarding <i>Sigarsvoll</i> cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with
which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark.
<i>Hotun</i> (“High Place”): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. <i>Himinvangar</i> (“Heaven’s Field”): an imaginary place. <i>Blood-snake</i>: a sword. <i>Sinfjotli</i>: cf. note on stanza 6.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb294a">[<a href="#pb294a" class="pginternal">294</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>Elm</i>: a not uncommon word for “man.” <i>Blood-flecked</i>: i.e., won in battle.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> <i>Fifteen</i>: until early in the eleventh century a Norwegian or Icelandic boy became “of age”
at twelve, and Maurer cites this passage as added proof of the poem’s lateness. <i>Hunding</i>: the annotator (introductory prose to <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> II) calls him king of Hundland, which shows no great originality. Saxo mentions a
Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi’s traditional
foe.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>Storm</i>, etc.: war.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Logafjoll</i> (“Flame-Mountain”): a mythical name. <i>Frothi</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb295a">[<a href="#pb295a" class="pginternal">295</a>]</span>a: traditional king of Denmark, whose peaceful reign was so famous that “Frothi’s
peace” became a by-word for peace of any kind. <i>Vithrir’s hounds</i>: wolves; Vithrir is Othin, and his hounds are the wolves Freki and Geri.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> In this poem Helgi kills all the sons of Hunding, but in the poems of the Sigurth
cycle, and the prose notes attached thereto, Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi,
are killed by Hunding’s sons, on whom Sigurth subsequently takes vengeance (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and <i>Regïnsmol</i>).
</p>
<p id="n2.3.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript, but almost certainly something has been lost
mentioning more specifically the coming of the Valkyries. The lightning which accompanies
them suggests again their identification with the clouds (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 28).
</p>
<p id="n2.3.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Some editions fill out the first line: “He saw there mighty maidens riding.” The
manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb296a">[<a href="#pb296a" class="pginternal">296</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Wolf-wood</i>: dark forest; the original word is not altogether clear. <i>Southern</i>: this variety of Valkyrie, like the swan-maidens of the <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, was clearly regarded as of southern (i.e., German) origin. Here again there is a
confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the <i>Voluspo</i> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much
earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun,
daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears
in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter
name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild,
daughter of Buthli.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>Breaker of rings</i>: generous prince, because the breaking of rings was the customary form of distributing
gold.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Granmar</i>: the annotator gives an account of him and his family in the prose following stanza
12 of <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II.</i>
</p>
<p id="n2.3.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the stanza with the fragmentary
stanza 21, and others fill in with “And home will carry   |   Hogni’s daughter.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb297a">[<a href="#pb297a" class="pginternal">297</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> The manuscript has only lines 1 and 4 with the word “first” of line 2, and does not
indicate Helgi as the speaker. The <i>Volsungasaga</i>, which follows this poem pretty closely, expands Helgi’s speech, and lines 2–3 are
conjectural versifications of the saga’s prose. <i>Isung</i>: nothing is known of him beyond the fact, here indicated, that Hothbrodd killed him.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> <i>Water’s gleam</i>: gold.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Brandey</i> (“Brand-Isle”): not mentioned elsewhere. <i>Hethinsey</i> (“Hethin’s Isle”): possibly the island of Hiddensee, east of Rügen.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb298a">[<a href="#pb298a" class="pginternal">298</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Stafnsnes</i> (“Steersman’s Cape”): an unidentifiable promontory. <i>Fair</i>: a guess, as the adjective in the manuscript is obscure. <i>Hjorleif</i> does not appear elsewhere, and seems to be simply one of Helgi’s lieutenants.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> <i>Tronueyr</i>: “Crane-Strand.” <i>Long-stemmed</i>: literally “long-headed,” as the high, curving stem of a Norse ship was often carved
to represent a head and neck. <i>Orvasund</i>: almost certainly the Danish Öresund, off Seeland. Such bits of geography as this
followed Helgi persistently.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript. <i>Hotun</i>: cf. stanza 8 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Line 3 seems to have been interpolated from line 4 of <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> II, 42. <i>Ship’s-tents</i>: the awnings spread over the deck to shelter the crews from sun and rain when the
ships were at anchor. <i>Varinsfjord</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 22 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb299a">[<a href="#pb299a" class="pginternal">299</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions
follow this arrangement, making lines 1–2 a separate stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, and some editions combine the stanza with lines
3–4 of stanza 28. <i>Sisters of Kolga</i>: the waves, Kolga (“The Gold”) being one of the daughters of the sea-god, Ægir. As
the <i>Volsungasaga</i> says, “Now there was a great storm.”
</p>
<p id="n2.3.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Helgi demonstrates his courage, whatever one may think of his seamanship. <i>Ægir’s daughters</i>: the waves; cf. stanza 29 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb300a">[<a href="#pb300a" class="pginternal">300</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> Sigrun here appears again as a Valkyrie. <i>Ron</i>: Ægir’s wife; cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 18 and note. <i>Sea-beast</i>: ship. <i>Gnipalund</i>: “Crag-Wood.”
</p>
<p id="n2.3.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> <i>Unavagar</i>: “Friendly Waves.” <i>Svarin’s hill</i>: the hill where Granmar had his dwelling.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Here begins the long dialogue between <i>Gothmund</i>, one of Granmar’s sons, and <i>Sinfjotli</i>, Helgi’s half-brother. Two lines (stanza 33, lines 3–4) are quoted by the annotator
in the prose note following stanza 16 of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay, and the
dialogue, in much abbreviated form, together with Helgi’s admonition to Sinfjotli
to cease talking, is closely paralleled in stanzas 22–27 of that poem. It has been
suggested that this whole passage (stanzas 33–48) is an interpolation, perhaps from
“the Old Volsung lay.” This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used
an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making
up a great deal more. The manuscript indicates no gap in stanza 33.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Sinfjotli</i>: cf. note on stanza 6. <i>Red</i>: raising a red shield was the signal for war.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb301a">[<a href="#pb301a" class="pginternal">301</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> <i>Ylfings</i>: cf. stanza 5 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>Quern</i>: turning the hand mill was, throughout antiquity, the task of slaves.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speakers in this dialogue. No gap indicated in the
manuscript, and editors have attempted various combinations of stanzas 37 and 38.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> <i>Wolves</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> tells that Sigmund and Sinfjotli lived in the woods for a time as werewolves. <i>Brothers</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb302a">[<a href="#pb302a" class="pginternal">302</a>]</span>Sinfjotli killed the two sons of his mother, Signy, and her husband, Siggeir, as part
of the vengeance wreaked on Siggeir for the treacherous murder of Sigmund’s father,
Volsung, and nine of his brothers (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note). The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Varin’s isle</i>: cf. stanza 27 and note, and <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 22. Reproaching a man with having been a woman and borne children was not uncommon.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> This stanza may be an interpolation in the dialogue passage. <i>Allfather</i>: Othin. We have no information regarding Gothmund’s career, but it looks as though
Sinfjotli were drawing solely on his imagination for his taunts, whereas Gothmund’s
insults have a basis in Sinfjotli’s previous life.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the two lines with stanza
40, some regard them as the first instead of the last lines of a separate stanza,
and some assume the lacuna here indicated. <i>Sogunes</i> (“Saga’s Cape”): of the goddess Saga little is known; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 7.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb303a">[<a href="#pb303a" class="pginternal">303</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.3.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> <i>Fenrir’s-wolves</i>: wolves in general. <i>Thorsnes</i>: “Thor’s Cape.”
</p>
<p id="n2.3.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The phrase “under houses,” which follows the manuscript, may be an error for “in
wolf-caves.” Line 3 (or 4) may be an interpolation. The manuscript indicates line
5 as the beginning of a new stanza. <i>Siggeir</i>: cf. stanza 38, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Several editions assign this stanza to Sinfjotli instead of to Gothmund. <i>Bravoll</i> (“Field of the Brow”): not elsewhere mentioned in the poems. <i>Grani</i>: Sigurth’s horse (cf. <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, 16 and note); Gothmund means that Sinfjotli had turned into a mare, after the fashion
of Loki (cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44, note). The meaning of line 4 in the original is uncertain.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> A few editions give this stanza to Gothmund. <i>Gollnir</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb304a">[<a href="#pb304a" class="pginternal">304</a>]</span>possibly a giant. <i>Imth</i>: nothing is known of him or his daughter.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> A few editions give this stanza to Sinfjotli. <i>Frekastein</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 39 and note. A stanza may have been lost after stanza 46, parallel to stanza 25
of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> <i>Ring-breakers</i>: cf. stanza 18 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> <i>Moinsheimar</i>: a battlefield of which nothing is known, where, however, the sons of Granmar appear
to have fought bravely.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> Here the scene shifts to the shore among Hothbrodd’s followers. <span class="pageNum" id="pb305a">[<a href="#pb305a" class="pginternal">305</a>]</span><i>Sviputh</i> and <i>Sveggjuth</i> (“Swift” and “Lithe”): horses’ names. <i>Mist’s horse</i>: the Valkyrie’s name is the same as the English word “mist,” and the “horse” on which
the mist rides is the earth. The two lines in parenthesis may be interpolated, or
line 5 may begin a new stanza, as the manuscript indicates.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript. <i>Hniflungs</i>: cf. introductory note.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> Lines 2–3 may be interpolated, or a new stanza may begin, as the manuscript indicates,
with line 5. Many editors combine lines 5–6 with all or part of stanza 52. Possibly
Gothmund is not the speaker. <i>Mast-ring harts</i>: ships, so called from the ring attaching the yard to the mast. <i>Ylfings</i>: cf. stanza 5 and note. <i>Sogn</i>: this name, which actually belongs in western Norway, seems to have been used here
with no particular significance.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.52"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.52" class="pginternal">52</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza; some editors combine lines
3–4 with all or part of stanza <span class="pageNum" id="pb306a">[<a href="#pb306a" class="pginternal">306</a>]</span>53, while others assume the loss of two lines following line 4. <i>Fire-beasts</i>: dragons, i.e., ships. The Norse ships of war, as distinguished from merchant vessels,
were often called dragons because of their shape and the carving of their stems.
</p>
<p id="n2.3.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.3.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and a few editors assume the loss of
one or two lines embodying the phrase “Hothbrodd spake.” In the manuscript line 3,

far <span class="pageNum" id="pb308a">[<a href="#pb308a" class="pginternal">308</a>]</span>enough so that Sigurth himself is once called a descendant of Yngvi (<i>Reginsmol</i>, 14). Gering identifies the name of Yngvi with the god Freyr, but the Volsungs certainly
claimed descent from Othin, not Freyr, and there is nothing to indicate that Helgi
in the Danish tradition was supposed to be descended from Freyr, whereas his descent
from Yngvi Halfdansson fits well with the rest of his story. However, cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 24 and note.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the general nature of the Helgi tradition has been considered in the introductory
note to <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, it is necessary here to discuss only the characteristics of this particular poem.
The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first
one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of
it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well
back into the tenth century.
</p>
<p>It is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up
of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious
prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13–16) is specifically identified as
coming from “the old Volsung lay.” What was that poem, and how much more of the extant
Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than
he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship,
and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or
nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which
was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the
odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together
on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his
knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.
</p>
<p>Section I (stanzas 1–4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi’s, in which he narrowly
escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding’s home in disguise. Section II (stanzas
5–12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas
13–16, the “old Volsung lay” group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when
she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17–21), which
may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and
Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly
an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas
22–27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310" class="pginternal">310</a>]</span>in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section
VI (stanzas 28–37) gives Dag’s speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi’s death,
her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza
38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly
out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39–50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi
and Sigrun’s visit to him in the burial hill.
</p>
<p>Sijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by
the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are
from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the “old Volsung
lay.” This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of
the question.
</p>
<p>Were it not for sections VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground
for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse
poetry. Sigrun’s curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for
her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial
hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the
poem.</p>

<p class="first" id="prose2.4">King Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their
son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi’s foster-father. Hunding was
the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior,
and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these
two, King Hunding and <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311" class="pginternal">311</a>]</span>King Sigmund, and each slew the other’s kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were
called Volsungs and Ylfings.

<p>Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King
Hunding’s, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:

<p>Granmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin’s hill. He had many sons;
one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings’
meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni’s daughter, for his wife.
But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi.
Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding’s sons; there he killed Alf
and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the
eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and
kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:

<p>Helgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a
perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw
in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then
the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar’s sons sat on a certain
mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode
for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their
sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p>Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host; <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319" class="pginternal">319</a>]</span>then Granmar’s sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun’s
father, and his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar’s sons
were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni’s son, was spared, and he swore loyalty
to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death.

<p>Helgi took Sigrun to wife, and they had sons. Helgi did not reach old age. Dag, the
son of Hogni, offered sacrifice to Othin to be avenged for his father’s death; Othin
gave Dag his spear. Dag found Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place which is called
Fjoturlund. He thrust the spear through Helgi’s body. Then Helgi fell, and Dag rode

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.4" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> In the manuscript the poem is headed “Of the Volsungs,” but most editions give it
the title used here. <i>Sigmund</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 6 and note, which also mentions <i>Volsung</i><span class="corr" title="Source: ." id="xd32e22023">,</span> <i>Borghild</i> and <i>Bralund</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 1 and note. <i>Helgi</i>: the annotator’s explanation that the child <span class="pageNum" id="pb311a">[<a href="#pb311a" class="pginternal">311</a>]</span>was named after Helgi Hjorvarthsson is a naive way of getting around the difficulties
created by the two sets of Helgi stories. He might equally well have said that the
new Helgi was the old one born again, as he accounts for Sigrun in this way (“she
was Svava reborn”). <i>Hagal</i>: not elsewhere mentioned; it was a common custom to have boys brought up by foster-parents.
<i>Hunding</i> and <i>Hundland</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 10 and note. <i>Volsungs</i> and <i>Ylfings</i>: regarding this confusion of family names cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 5 and note. <i>Hæming</i>: his name does not appear in the list of Hunding’s sons. It is quite possible that
these opening stanzas (1–4) do not refer to Hunding at all.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> Helgi appears to have stayed with Hunding under the name of Hamal, but now, thinking
himself safe, he sends word of who he really is. <i>Hunding</i>: it has been suggested that the compiler may have inserted this name to fit what
he thought the story ought to be, in place of Hæming, or even Hadding. If stanzas
1–4 are a fragment of the <i>Karuljoth</i> (<i>Lay of Kara</i>), this latter suggestion is quite reasonable, for in that poem, which we do not possess,
but which supplied material for the compilers of the <i>Hromundar saga Greipssonar</i>, Helgi appears as Helgi Haddingjaskati (cf. final prose note). Nothing beyond this
one name connects stanzas 1–4 with Hunding.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb312a">[<a href="#pb312a" class="pginternal">312</a>]</span></p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.1" class="pginternal">Prose</a><span class="corr" title="Source: ," id="xd32e22073">.</span></i> <i>Hagal</i>: Helgi’s foster-father, who naturally protects him.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 2 as the beginning of the stanza, the copyist evidently
regarding line 1 as prose. This has caused various rearrangements in the different
editions. <i>Blind</i>: leader of the band sent to capture Helgi.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. <i>Barley</i>: the word literally means “foreign grain,” and would afford an interesting study
to students of early commerce.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> Possibly two stanzas with one line lost, or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are
spurious; each editor has his own guess. <i>Sigar</i> and <i>Hogni</i>: it seems unlikely that Hagal refers to the Hogni who was Sigrun’s father, for this
part of the story has nothing whatever to do with Sigrun. As Hagal is, of course,
deliberately <span class="pageNum" id="pb313a">[<a href="#pb313a" class="pginternal">313</a>]</span>lying, it is useless to test any part of his speech for accuracy.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.4" class="pginternal">Prose</a><span class="corr" title="Source: ," id="xd32e22110">.</span></i> No division indicated in the manuscript. <i>Brunavagar</i> (“Bruni’s Sea”): mentioned only in this section. <i>Strand-slaughtering</i>: a killing on the shore of cattle stolen in a raid. <i>Hogni</i> and <i>Sigrun</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 17 and note; the annotator’s notion of Sigrun as the reincarnated Svava (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, concluding prose note) represents a naive form of scholarship. There is nothing
in stanzas 5–12 which clearly identifies Sigrun as a Valkyrie, or which, except for
the last line of stanza 12, identifies the speaker as Sigrun. Some editors, therefore,
call her simply “the Valkyrie,” while <span class="pageNum" id="pb314a">[<a href="#pb314a" class="pginternal">314</a>]</span>Vigfusson, who thinks this section is also a remnant of the <i>Karuljoth</i>, calls her Kara.
</p>
<p><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. <i>Hamal</i>: Helgi’s assumption of this name seems to link this section (stanzas 5–12) with stanza
1. <i>Hlesey</i> (“Island of Hler”—i.e., Ægir, the sea-god): generally identified as the Danish island
of Läsö; cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 37 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Guth</i>: a Valkyrie (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31); the birds of her sisters are the kites and ravens.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza; some editors reject
lines 1–2, while others make lines 5–6 into a fragmentary stanza. <i>Ylfings</i>: cf. introductory prose and note. <i>Bragalund</i> (“Bragi’s Wood”): a mythical place. <i>Bears</i>: presumably Berserkers, regarding whom cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 23.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb315a">[<a href="#pb315a" class="pginternal">315</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.4.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Helgi’s meaning in lines 3–4 is that, although he has already declared himself an
Ylfing (stanza 8, line 1), there are many heroes of that race, and he does not understand
how Sigrun knows him to be Helgi.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> <i>Slaughter-runes</i>: equivocal or deceptive speech regarding the battle. The word “rune” had the meaning
of “magic” or “mystery” long before it was applied to the signs or characters with
which it was later identified.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Some editors reject line 3, others line 5. The manuscript omits Helgi’s name in line
5, thereby destroying both the sense and the meter. Vigfusson, following his <i>Karuljoth</i> theory (cf. <span class="pageNum" id="pb316a">[<a href="#pb316a" class="pginternal">316</a>]</span>note on prose following stanza 4), changes Hogni to Halfdan, father of Kara.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.12" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript indicates no division. Most of this prose passage is evidently based
on <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>; the only new features are the introduction of <i>Starkath</i> as a third son of Granmar, which is clearly an error based on a misunderstanding
of stanza 19, and the reference to the <i>kings’ meeting</i>, based on stanza 15. Kings’ meetings, or councils, were by no means unusual; the
North in early days was prolific in kings. For the remaining names, cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb317a">[<a href="#pb317a" class="pginternal">317</a>]</span><i>Granmar</i>, stanza 19; <i>Hothbrodd</i>, stanza 19; <i>Gothmund</i>, stanza 33; <i>Svarin’s hill</i>, stanza 32; <i>Logafjoll</i>, stanza 13; <i>Alf</i>, <i>Eyjolf</i>, <i>Hjorvarth</i> and <i>Hervarth</i>, stanza 14. <i>The old Volsung lay</i>: cf. Introductory Note.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Some editions combine lines 3–4, or line 4, with part of stanza 14.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The lines of stanzas 14 and 15 are here rearranged in accordance with Bugge’s emendation;
in the manuscript they stand as follows: lines 3–4 of stanza 14; stanza 15; lines
1–2 of stanza 14. This confusion has given rise to various editorial conjectures.

<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.16" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript indicates no division. Here again, the annotator has drawn practically
all his information from <i>Helgakvitha <span class="pageNum" id="pb318a">[<a href="#pb318a" class="pginternal">318</a>]</span>Hundingsbana I</i>, which he specifically mentions and even quotes. The only new features are the names
of Hogni’s sons, <i>Bragi</i> and <i>Dag</i>. Bragi is mentioned in stanza 18, though it is not there stated that he is Hogni’s
son. Dag, who figures largely in stanzas 28–34, is a puzzle, for the verse never names
him, and it is an open question where the annotator got his name. <i>Frekastein</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, 39 and note. <i>As is written</i>: the two lines are quoted, with a change of two words, from <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 33. <i>Sinfjotli</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 6 and note, and stanzas 33–48, in which the whole dialogue is given. <i>Loyalty</i>: apparently the annotator got this bit of information out of stanza 29, in which
Sigrun refers to the oaths which her brother had sworn to Helgi.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb319a">[<a href="#pb319a" class="pginternal">319</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.4.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Sevafjoll</i> (“Wet Mountain”): mentioned only in this poem. <i>Giant-steeds</i>: wolves, the usual steeds of giantesses; cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 56.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>Maid</i>: the word thus rendered is the same doubtful one which appears in <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, 1 and 5, and which may mean specifically a Valkyrie (Gering translates it “helmed”
or “heroic”) or simply “wise.” Cf. <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, note on introductory prose. <i>Norns</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 20 and note. In stanza 33 Dag similarly lays the blame for the murder he has committed
on Othin. <i>Bragi</i>: probably Sigrun’s brother.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> This stanza looks like an interpolation, and there is little <span class="pageNum" id="pb320a">[<a href="#pb320a" class="pginternal">320</a>]</span>or nothing to connect it with the slaying of Granmar’s sons. In the manuscript line
2, indicated as the beginning of a stanza, precedes line 1. <i>Hlebjorg</i> (“Sea-Mountain”) and <i>Styrkleifar</i> (“Battle-Cliffs”): place names not elsewhere mentioned. Of <i>Hrollaug’s sons</i> nothing further is known. <i>Starkath</i>: this name gives a hint of the origin of this stanza, for Saxo Grammaticus tells
of the slaying of the Swedish hero Starkath (“The Strong”) the son of Storverk, and
describes how his severed head bit the ground in anger (cf. line 4). In all probability
this stanza is from an entirely different poem, dealing with the Starkath story, and
the annotator’s attempt to identify the Swedish hero as a third son of Granmar is
quite without foundation.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> The difference of meter would of itself be enough to indicate that this stanza comes
from an entirely different poem. A few editions assign the whole stanza to Helgi,
but lines 3–4 are almost certainly Sigrun’s, and the manuscript begins line 3 with
a large capital letter following a period.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb321a">[<a href="#pb321a" class="pginternal">321</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.4.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> With this stanza begins the dispute between Gothmund and Sinfjotli which, together
with Helgi’s rebuke to his half-brother, appears at much greater length in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 33–48. It is introduced here manifestly in the wrong place. The version here given
is almost certainly the older of the two, but the resemblance is so striking, and
in some cases (notably in Helgi’s rebuke) the stanzas are so nearly identical, that
it seems probable that the composer of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay borrowed directly
from the poem of which the present dialogue is a fragment. <i>Flag</i>: the banner (“gunnfani,” cf. “gonfalon”) here serves as the signal for war instead
of the red shield mentioned in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 34. <i>Battle-light</i>: perhaps the “northern lights.”
</p>
<p id="n2.4.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Lines 3–4 are obscure, and in the manuscript show signs of error. Helgi had not at
this time, so far as we know, conquered any of Hothbrodd’s land. <i>The realm of the fishes</i>, in line 4, presumably means the sea, but the word here translated “fishes” is obscure,
and many editors treat it as a proper name, “the realm of the Fjorsungs,” but without
further suggestion as to who or what the Fjorsungs are.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb322a">[<a href="#pb322a" class="pginternal">322</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.4.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> The word here translated <i>swords</i> is a conjectural emendation; the manuscript implies merely an invitation to continue
the quarrel at Frekastein. <i>Hothbrodd</i>: apparently he is here considered as present during the dispute; some editors, in
defiance of the meter, have emended the line to mean “Time is it for Hothbrodd   |  
vengeance to have.”
</p>
<p id="n2.4.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.26" class="pginternal">26–27</a>.</span> Cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 47–48, which are nearly identical. Stanza 27 in the manuscript is abbreviated
to the first letters of the words, except for line 5, which does not appear in the
other poem, and which looks like an interpolation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb323a">[<a href="#pb323a" class="pginternal">323</a>]</span></p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.27" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Here begins a new section of the poem, dealing with Helgi’s death at the hands of
<i>Dag</i>, Sigrun’s brother. The note is based wholly on stanzas 28–34, except for the introduction
of Dag’s name (cf. note on prose following stanza 16), and the reference to <i>Othin’s spear</i>, the weapon which made victory certain, and which the annotator brought in doubtless
on the strength of Dag’s statement that Othin was responsible for Helgi’s death (stanza
33). <i>Fjoturlund</i> (“Fetter-Wood”): mentioned only here and in stanza 28.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Line 5 looks like an interpolation.

According
to the annotator, Dag’s life had been spared because he swore loyalty to Helgi.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript, but most editors have assumed that either the
first or the last two lines have been lost. Bugge adds a line: “The shield shall not
help thee   |   which thou holdest.”

<p id="n2.4.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Line 5 may be spurious. <i>Vigblær</i> (“Battle-Breather”): Helgi’s horse.

<p id="n2.4.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Line 5 (or possibly line 4) may be spurious. Cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 17, and <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 2.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.37" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Valhall</i>, etc.: there is no indication as to where the annotator got this notion of Helgi’s
sharing Othin’s rule. It is <span class="pageNum" id="pb326a">[<a href="#pb326a" class="pginternal">326</a>]</span>most unlikely that such an idea ever found place in any of the Helgi poems, or at
least in the earlier ones; probably it was a late development of the tradition in
a period when Othin was no longer taken seriously.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> This stanza apparently comes from an otherwise lost passage containing a contest
of words between Helgi and Hunding; indeed the name of Hunding may have been substituted
for another one beginning with “H,” and the stanza originally have had no connection
with Helgi at all. The annotator inserts it here through an obvious misunderstanding,
taking it to be Helgi’s application of the power conferred on him by Othin.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> Here begins the final section (stanzas 39–50), wherein Sigrun visits the dead Helgi
in his burial hill. <i>Doom of the gods</i>: the phrase “ragna rök” has been rather unfortunately Anglicized into the <span class="corr" title="Source: work" id="xd32e22462">word</span> “ragnarok” (the Norse term is not a proper name), <span class="pageNum" id="pb327a">[<a href="#pb327a" class="pginternal">327</a>]</span>and <i>rök</i>, “doom,” has been confused with <i>rökkr</i>, “darkness,” and so translated “dusk of the Gods,” or “<span lang="de">Götterdämmerung</span>.”
</p>
<p id="n2.4.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> In the manuscript most of this stanza is abbreviated to the first letters of the
words.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> Line 3 (or possibly line 2) may be spurious. <i>Sword-tracks</i>: wounds. One edition places stanza 48 after stanza 41, and another does the same
with stanza 50.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb328a">[<a href="#pb328a" class="pginternal">328</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.4.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> Possibly lines 5–6 are spurious, or part of a stanza the rest of which has been lost.
It has also been suggested that two lines may have been lost after line 2, making
a new stanza of lines 3–6. <i>Kinsman</i>: literally “son-in-law.”
</p>
<p id="n2.4.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Lines 4 and 6 have been marked by various editors as probably spurious. Others regard
lines 1–2 as the beginning of a stanza the rest of which has been lost, or combine
lines 5–6 with lines 5–6 of stanza 45 to make a new stanza. <i>South-maid</i>: cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 17 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> Both lines 3–4 and lines 5–6 have been suspected by editors of being interpolated,
and the loss of two lines has also been suggested. <i>Brides</i>: the plural here is perplexing. Gering insists that only Sigrun is meant, and translates
the word as singular, but both “brides” and “loves” are uncompromisingly plural in
<span class="pageNum" id="pb329a">[<a href="#pb329a" class="pginternal">329</a>]</span>the text. Were the men of Helgi’s ghostly following likewise visited by their wives?
The annotator may have thought so, for in the prose he mentions the “women” returning
to the house, although, of course, this may refer simply to Sigrun and the maid.
</p>
<p id="n2.4.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> Line 5 (or possibly line 4) may be interpolated.

<p id="n2.4.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.4.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> Many editors assign this speech to the maid. Line 5 (or 4) may be spurious. <i>Meeting of dreams</i> (“Dream-Thing”): sleep.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.4.50" class="pginternal">Prose</a><span class="corr" title="Source: ," id="xd32e22550">.</span></i> The attitude of the annotator is clearly revealed by his contempt for those who put
any faith in such “old wives’ folly” as the idea that men and women could be reborn.
As in the case of Helgi Hjorvarthsson, the theory of the hero’s rebirth seems to have
developed in order to unite around a single Helgi <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331" class="pginternal">331</a>]</span>the various stories in which the hero is slain. The <i>Lay of Kara</i> (<i>Karuljoth</i>) is lost, although, as has been pointed out, parts of the <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i> may be remnants of it, but we find the main outlines of the story in the <i>Hromundar saga Greipssonar</i>, whose compilers appear to have known the <i>Karuljoth</i>. In the saga Helgi Haddingjaskati (Helgi the Haddings’-Hero) is protected by the
Valkyrie Kara, who flies over him in the form of a swan (note once more the Valkyrie
swan-maiden confusion); but in his fight with Hromund he swings his sword so high
that he accidentally gives Kara a mortal wound, whereupon Hromund cuts off his head.
As this makes the third recorded death of Helgi (once at the hands of Alf, once at
those of Dag, and finally in the fight with Hromund), the phenomenon of his rebirth
is not surprising. The points of resemblance in all the Helgi stories, including the
one told in the lost <i>Karuljoth</i>, are sufficiently striking so that it is impossible not to see in them a common origin,
and not to believe that Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, Helgi the son of Sigmund and Helgi
the Haddings’-Hero (not to mention various other Helgis who probably figured in songs
and stories now lost) were all originally the same Helgi who appears in the early
traditions of Denmark.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been pointed out that the Helgi tradition, coming originally from Denmark,
was early associated with that of the Volsungs, which was of German, or rather of
Frankish, origin (cf. Introductory Note to <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>). The connecting links between these two sets of stories were few in number, the
main point being the identification of Helgi as a son of Sigmund Volsungsson. Another
son of Sigmund, however, appears in the Helgi poems, though not in any of the poems
dealing with the Volsung cycle proper. This is Sinfjotli, whose sole function in the
extant Helgi lays is to have a wordy dispute with Gothmund Granmarsson.
</p>
<p>Sinfjotli’s history is told in detail in the early chapters of the <i>Volsungasaga</i>. The twin sister of Sigmund Volsungsson, Signy, had married Siggeir, who hated his
brother-in-law by reason of his desire to possess a sword which had belonged to Othin
and been won by Sigmund. Having treacherously invited Volsung and his ten sons to
visit him, Siggeir slew Volsung and captured his sons, who were set in the stocks.
Each night a wolf (“some men say that she was Siggeir’s mother”) came out of the woods
and ate up one of the brothers, till on the tenth night Sigmund alone was left. Then,
however, Signy aided him to escape, and incidentally to kill the wolf. He vowed vengeance
on Siggeir, and Signy, who hated her husband, was determined to help him. Convinced
that Sigmund must have a helper of his own race, Signy changed forms with a witch,
and in this guise sought out Sigmund, who, not knowing who she was, spent three nights
with her. Thereafter she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Sinfjotli (“The Yellow-Spotted”?),
whom she sent to Sigmund. For a time they lived in the woods, occasionally turning
into wolves (whence perhaps Sinfjotli’s name). When Sinfjotli was full grown, he and
his father came to Siggeir’s house, but were seen and betrayed by the two young sons
of Signy and Siggeir, whereupon Sinfjotli slew them. Siggeir promptly had Sigmund
and Sinfjotli buried alive, but Signy managed to smuggle Sigmund’s famous sword into
the grave, and with this the father and son dug themselves out. The next night they
burned Siggeir’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333" class="pginternal">333</a>]</span>house, their enemy dying in the flames, and Signy, who had at the last refused to
leave her husband, from a sense of somewhat belated loyalty, perishing with him.
</p>
<p>Was this story, which the <i>Volsungasaga</i> relates in considerable detail, the basis of an old poem which has been lost? Almost
certainly it was, although, as I have pointed out, many if not most of the old stories
appear to have been handed down rather in prose than in verse, for the <i>Volsungasaga</i> quotes two lines of verse regarding the escape from the grave. At any rate, Sinfjotli
early became a part of the Volsung tradition, which, in turn, formed the basis for
no less than fifteen poems generally included in the Eddic collection. Of this tradition
we may recognize three distinct parts: the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story; the Helgi
story, and the Sigurth story, the last of these three being by far the most extensive,
and suggesting an almost limitless amount of further subdivision. With the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli
story the Sigurth legend is connected only by the fact that Sigurth appears as Sigmund’s
son by his last wife, Hjordis; with the Helgi legend it is not connected directly
at all. Aside from the fact that Helgi appears as Sigmund’s son by his first wife,
Borghild, the only link between the Volsung story proper and that of Helgi is the
appearance of Sinfjotli in two of the Helgi poems. Originally it is altogether probable
that the three stories, or sets of stories, were entirely distinct, and that Sigurth
(the familiar Siegfried) had little or nothing more to do with the Volsungs of northern
mythological-heroic tradition than he had with Helgi.
</p>
<p>The annotator or compiler of the collection of poems preserved in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, having finished with the Helgi lays, had before him the task of setting down the
fifteen complete or fragmentary poems dealing with the Sigurth story. Before doing
this, however, he felt it incumbent on him to dispose of both Sigmund and Sinfjotli,
the sole links with the two other sets of stories. He apparently knew of no poem or
poems concerning the deaths of these two; perhaps there were none, though this is
unlikely. Certainly the story of how Sinfjotli and Sigmund died was current in oral
prose tradition, and this story the compiler set forth in the short prose passage
entitled <i>Of Sinfjotli’s Death</i> which, in <i>Regius</i>, immediately follows the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbane. The relation of this passage
to the prose of the <i>Reginsmol</i> is discussed in the introductory note to that poem.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="prose2.5">Sigmund, the son of Volsung, was a king in the land of the Franks; Sinfjotli was his
eldest son, the second was Helgi, and the third Hamund. Borghild, Sigmund’s wife,
had a brother who was named ——. Sinfjotli, her stepson, and —— both wooed the same
woman, wherefore Sinfjotli slew him. And when he came home, Borghild bade him depart,
but Sigmund offered her atonement-money, and this she had to accept. At the funeral
feast Borghild brought in ale; she took poison, a great horn full, and brought it
to Sinfjotli. But when he looked into the horn, he saw that it was poison, and said
to Sigmund: “Muddy is the drink, Father!” Sigmund took the horn and drank therefrom.
It is said that Sigmund was so hardy that poison might not harm him, either outside
or in, but all his sons could withstand poison only without on their skin. Borghild
bore another horn to Sinfjotli and bade him drink, and all happened as before. And
yet a third time she brought him a horn, and spoke therewith scornful <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335" class="pginternal">335</a>]</span>words of him if he should not drink from it. He spoke as before with Sigmund. The
latter said: “Let it trickle through your beard, Son!” Sinfjotli drank, and straightway
was dead. Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a narrow and long fjord,
and there was a little boat and a man in it. He offered to take Sigmund across the
fjord. But when Sigmund had borne the corpse out into the boat, then the craft was
full. The man told Sigmund to go round the inner end of the fjord. Then the man pushed
the boat off, and disappeared.
</p>
<p>King Sigmund dwelt long in Denmark in Borghild’s kingdom after he had married her.
Thereafter Sigmund went south into the land of the Franks, to the kingdom which he
had there. There he married Hjordis, the daughter of King Eylimi; their son was Sigurth.
King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding, and Hjordis then married Alf
the son of King Hjalprek. There Sigurth grew up in his boyhood. Sigmund and all his
sons were far above all other men in might and stature and courage and every kind
of ability. Sigurth, however, was the foremost of all, and all men call him in the
old tales the noblest of mankind and the mightiest leader.

<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.5" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Regarding <i>Sigmund</i>, <i>Sinfjotli</i>, and <i>Volsung</i> see Introductory Note. <i>The Franks</i>: although the Sigurth story had reached the North as early as the sixth or seventh
century, it never lost all the marks of its Frankish origin. <i>Helgi</i> and <i>Hamund</i>: sons of Sigmund and Borghild; Helgi is, of course Helgi Hundingsbane; of Hamund
nothing further is recorded. <i>Borghild</i>: the manuscript leaves a blank for the name of her brother; evidently the compiler
hoped some day to discover it and write it in, but never did. A few editions insert
wholly unauthorized names from late paper manuscripts, such as Hroar, Gunnar, or Borgar.
In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Borghild bids Sinfjotli drink “if he has the courage of a Volsung.” Sigmund gives
his advice because “the king was very drunk, and that was why he spoke thus.” Gering,
on the other hand, gives Sigmund credit for having believed that the draught would
deposit its poisonous <span class="pageNum" id="pb335a">[<a href="#pb335a" class="pginternal">335</a>]</span>contents in Sinfjotli’s beard, and thus do him no harm. <i>Boat</i>: the man who thus carries off the dead Sinfjotli in his boat is presumably Othin.
<i>Denmark</i>: Borghild belongs to the Danish Helgi part of the story. <i>The Franks</i>: with this the Danish and Norse stories of Helgi and Sinfjotli come to an end, and
the Frankish story of Sigurth begins. Sigmund’s two kingdoms are an echo of the blended
traditions. <i>Hjordis</i>: just where this name came from is not clear, for in the German story Siegfried’s
mother is Sigelint, but the name of the father of Hjordis, <i>Eylimi</i>, gives a clew, for Eylimi is the father of Svava, wife of Helgi Hjorvarthsson. <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336" class="pginternal">336</a>]</span>Doubtless the two men are not identical, but it seems likely that both Eylimi and
Hjordis were introduced into the Sigmund-Sigurth story, the latter replacing Sigelint,
from some version of the Helgi tradition. <i>Hunding</i>: in the Helgi lays the sons of Hunding are all killed, but they reappear here and
in two of the poems (<i>Gripisspo</i>, 9, and <i>Reginsmol</i>, 15), and the <i>Volsungasaga</i> names Lyngvi as the son of Hunding who, as the rejected lover of Hjordis, kills Sigmund
and his father-in-law, Eylimi, as well. The episode of Hunding and his sons belongs
entirely to the Danish (Helgi) part of the story; the German legend knows nothing
of it, and permits the elderly Sigmund to outlive his son. There was doubtless a poem
on this battle, for the <i>Volsungasaga</i> quotes two lines spoken by the dying Sigmund to Hjordis before he tells her to give
the pieces of his broken sword to their unborn son. <i>Alf</i>: after the battle, according to the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, Lyngvi Hundingsson tried to capture Hjordis, but she was rescued by the sea-rover
Alf, son of King Hjalprek of Denmark, who subsequently married her. Here is another
trace of the Danish Helgi tradition. The <i>Nornageststhattr</i> briefly tells the same story.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Gripisspo</i> immediately follows the prose <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, and is contained in no other early manuscript. It is unquestionably one of the latest
of the poems in the Eddic collection; most critics agree in calling it the latest
of all, dating it not much before the year 1200. Its author (for in this instance
the word may be correctly used) was not only familiar with the other poems of the
Sigurth cycle, but seems to have had actual written copies of them before him; it
has, indeed, been suggested, and not without plausibility, that the <i>Gripisspo</i> may have been written by the very man who compiled and annotated the collection of
poems preserved in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>.
</p>
<p>In form the poem is a dialogue between the youthful Sigurth and his uncle, Gripir,
but in substance it is a condensed outline of Sigurth’s whole career as told piecemeal
in the older poems. The writer was sufficiently skillful in the handling of verse,
but he was utterly without inspiration; his characters are devoid of vitality, and
their speeches are full of conventional phrases, with little force or incisiveness.
At the same time, the poem is of considerable interest as giving, in brief form, a
summary of the story of Sigurth as it existed in Iceland (for the <i>Gripisspo</i> is almost certainly Icelandic) in the latter half of the twelfth century.
</p>
<p>It is not desirable here to go in detail into the immensely complex question of the
origin, growth, and spread of the story of Sigurth (Siegfried). The volume of critical
literature on the subject is enormous, and although some of the more patently absurd
theories have been eliminated, there are still wide divergencies of opinion regarding
many important points. At the same time, a brief review of the chief facts is necessary
in order to promote a clearer understanding of the poems which follow, and which make
up more than a third of the Eddic collection.
</p>
<p>That the story of Sigurth reached the North from Germany, having previously developed
among the Franks of the Rhine country, is now universally recognized. How and when
it spread from northwestern Germany into Scandinavia are less certainly known. It
spread, indeed, in every direction, so that traces of it <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338" class="pginternal">338</a>]</span>are found wherever Frankish influence was extensively felt; but it was clearly better
known and more popular in Norway, and in the settlements established by Norwegians,
than anywhere else. We have historical proof that there was considerable contact,
commercial and otherwise, between the Franks of northwestern Germany and the Norwegians
(but not the Swedes or the Danes) throughout the period from 600 to 800; coins of
Charlemagne have been found in Norway, and there is other evidence showing a fairly
extensive interchange of ideas as well as of goods. Presumably, then, the story of
the Frankish hero found its way into Norway in the seventh century. While, at this
stage of its development, it may conceivably have included a certain amount of verse,
it is altogether probable that the story as it came into Norway in the seventh century
was told largely in prose, and that, even after the poets had got hold of it, the
legend continued to live among the people in the form of oral prose saga.
</p>
<p>The complete lack of contemporary material makes it impossible for us to speak with
certainty regarding the character and content of the Sigurth legend as it existed
in the Rhine country in the seventh century. It is, however, important to remember
the often overlooked fact that any popular traditional hero became a magnet for originally
unrelated stories of every kind. It must also be remembered that in the early Middle
Ages there existed no such distinction between fiction and history as we now make;
a saga, for instance, might be anything from the most meticulously accurate history
to the wildest of fairy tales, and a single saga might (and sometimes did) combine
both elements. This was equally true of the Frankish traditions, and the two principles
just stated account for most of the puzzling phenomena in the growth of the Sigurth
story.
</p>
<p>Of the origin of Sigurth himself we know absolutely nothing. No historical analogy
can be made to fit in the slightest degree. If one believes in the possibility of
resolving hero stories into nature myths, he may be explained in that fashion, but
such a solution is not necessary. The fact remains that from very early days Sigurth
(Sifrit) was a great traditional hero among the Franks. The tales of his strength
and valor, of his winning of a great treasure, of his wooing a more or less supernatural
bride, and of his death at the hands of his kinsmen, probably were early features
of this legend.
</p>
<p>The next step was the blending of this story with one which <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339" class="pginternal">339</a>]</span>had a clear basis in history. In the year 437 the Burgundians, under their king, Gundicarius
(so the Latin histories call him), were practically annihilated by the Huns. The story
of this great battle soon became one of the foremost of Rhineland traditions; and
though Attila was presumably not present in person, he was quite naturally introduced
as the famous ruler of the invading hordes. The dramatic story of Attila’s death in
the year 453 was likewise added to the tradition, and during the sixth century the
chain was completed by linking together the stories of Sigurth and those of the Burgundian
slaughter. Gundicarius becomes the Gunther of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and the Gunnar of the Eddic poems; Attila becomes Etzel and Atli. A still further
development came through the addition of another, and totally unrelated, set of historical
traditions based on the career of Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about the
year 376. Ermanarich figures largely in many stories unconnected with the Sigurth
cycle, but, with the zeal of the medieval story-tellers for connecting their heroes,
he was introduced as the husband of Sigurth’s daughter, Svanhild, herself originally
part of a separate narrative group, and as Jormunrek he plays a considerable part
in a few of the Eddic poems.
</p>
<p>Such, briefly, appears to have been the development of the legend before it came into
Norway. Here it underwent many changes, though the clear marks of its southern origin
were never obliterated. The names were given Scandinavian forms, and in some cases
were completely changed (e.g., Kriemhild becomes Guthrun). New figures, mostly of
secondary importance, were introduced, and a large amount of purely Northern local
color was added. Above all, the earlier part of the story was linked with Northern
mythology in a way which seems to have had no counterpart among the southern Germanic
peoples. The Volsungs become direct descendants of Othin; the gods are closely concerned
with Fafnir’s treasure, and so on. Above all, the Norse story-tellers and poets changed
the figure of Brynhild. In making her a Valkyrie, sleeping on the flame-girt rock,
they were never completely successful, as she persisted in remaining, to a considerable
extent, the entirely human daughter of Buthli whom Sigurth woos for Gunnar. This confusion,
intensified by a mixing of names (cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, introductory note), and much resembling that which existed in the parallel cases
of Svava and Sigrun in the Helgi tradition, created difficulties <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340" class="pginternal">340</a>]</span>which the Norse poets and story-tellers were never able to smooth out, and which have
perplexed commentators ever since.
</p>
<p class="tb"/><p>
</p>
<p>Those who read the Sigurth poems in the <i>Edda</i>, or the story told in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, expecting to find a critically accurate biography of the hero, will, of course,
be disappointed. If, however, they will constantly keep in mind the general manner
in which the legend grew, its accretions ranging all the way from the Danube to Iceland,
they will find that most of the difficulties are simply the natural results of conflicting
traditions. Just as the Danish Helgi had to be “reborn” twice in order to enable three
different men to kill him, so the story of Sigurth, as told in the Eddic poems, involves
here and there inconsistencies explicable only when the historical development of
the story is taken into consideration.</p>

<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.6" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript gives the poem no title. <i>Gripir</i>: this uncle of Sigurth’s was probably a pure invention of the poet’s. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> mentions him, but presumably only because of his appearance here. On <i>Eylimi</i> and <i>Hjordis</i> see <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note. <i>Geitir</i>, the serving-man, is likewise apparently an invention of the poet’s.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speakers anywhere in the poem. Some editors
have made separate stanzas out of the two-line speeches in stanzas 1, 3 and 6.

<p id="n2.6.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Sigurth</i>: a few editions use in the verse the older form of this name, “Sigvorth,” though
the manuscript here keeps to the form used in this translation. The Old High German
“Sigifrid” (“Peace-Bringer through Victory”) became the Norse “Sigvorth” (“Victory-Guarder”),
this, in turn, becoming “Sigurth.”
</p>
<p id="n2.6.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> Bugge thinks a stanza has been lost after stanza 4, in which Geitir tells Gripir
who Sigurth is.

<p id="n2.6.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Grani</i>: Sigurth’s horse. According to the <i>Volsungasaga</i> his father was Sleipnir, Othin’s eight-legged horse, and Othin himself gave him to
Sigurth. The introductory note to the <i>Reginsmol</i> tells a different story.

<p id="n2.6.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>Thy father</i>: on the death of Sigmund and <i>Eylimi</i> at the hands of <i>Hunting’s sons</i> see <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note.

<p id="n2.6.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> <i>The dragon</i>: <i>Fafnir</i>, brother of the dwarf Regin, who turns himself into a dragon to guard Andvari’s hoard;
cf. <i>Reginsmol</i> and <i>Fafnismol</i>. <i>Gnitaheith</i>: a relic of the German tradition; it has been identified as lying south of Paderborn.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Gjuki</i>: the Norse form of the name Gibeche (“The Giver”). Gjuki is the father of Gunnar,
Hogni, and Guthrun, the family which reflects most directly the Burgundian part of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb344a">[<a href="#pb344a" class="pginternal">344</a>]</span>the tradition (cf. Introductory Note). The statement that Sigurth is to go direct
from the slaying of Fafnir to Gjuki’s hall involves one of the confusions resulting
from the dual personality of Brynhild. In the older (and the original South Germanic)
story, Sigurth becomes a guest of the Gjukungs before he has ever heard of Brynhild,
and first sees her when, having changed forms with Gunnar, he goes to woo her for
the latter. In another version he finds Brynhild before he visits the Gjukungs, only
to forget her as the result of the magic draught administered by Guthrun’s mother.
Both these versions are represented in the poems of which the author of the <i>Gripisspo</i> made use, and he tried, rather clumsily, to combine them, by having Sigurth go to
Gjuki’s house, then find the unnamed Valkyrie, and then return to Gjuki, the false
wooing following this second visit.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Basing his story on the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, the poet here tells of Sigurth’s finding of the Valkyrie, whom he does not identify
with Brynhild, daughter of Buthli (stanza 27), at all. His error in this respect is
not surprising, in view of Brynhild’s dual identity (cf. Introductory Note, and <i>Fafnismol</i>, 44 and note). <span class="pageNum" id="pb345a">[<a href="#pb345a" class="pginternal">345</a>]</span><i>Helgi</i>: according to <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i> (stanza 8), with which the author of the <i>Gripisspo</i> was almost certainly familiar, the hero for whose death Brynhild was punished was
named Hjalmgunnar. Is Helgi here identical with Hjalmgunnar, or did the author make
a mistake? Finnur Jonsson thinks the author regarded Sigurth’s Valkyrie as a fourth
incarnation of Svava-Sigrun-Kara, and wrote Helgi’s name in deliberately. Many editors,
following Bugge, have tried to reconstruct line 2 so as to get rid of Helgi’s name.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>Heimir</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> says that Heimir was the husband of Brynhild’s sister, Bekkhild. Brynhild’s family
connections <span class="pageNum" id="pb346a">[<a href="#pb346a" class="pginternal">346</a>]</span>involve a queer mixture of northern and southern legend. Heimir and Bekkhild are purely
of northern invention; neither of them is mentioned in any of the earlier poems, though
Brynhild speaks of her “foster-father” in <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>. In the older Norse poems Brynhild is a sister of Atli (Attila), a relationship wholly
foreign to the southern stories, and the father of this strangely assorted pair is
Buthli, who in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> is apparently Etzel’s grandfather. Add to this her role of Valkyrie, and it is small
wonder that the annotator himself was puzzled.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb347a">[<a href="#pb347a" class="pginternal">347</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.6.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> <i>Brynhild</i> (“Armed Warrior”): on her and her family see Introductory Note and note to stanza
19.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb349a">[<a href="#pb349a" class="pginternal">349</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.6.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Most editions have no comma after line 3, and change the meaning to “Fain of thee
  |   the fair-haired one / For her daughter is.” <i>Grimhild</i>: in the northern form of the story Kriemhild, Gunther’s sister and Siegfried’s wife,
becomes Grimhild, mother of Gunnar and Guthrun, the latter taking Kriemhild’s place.
The <i>Volsungasaga</i> tells how Grimhild gave Sigurth a magic draught which made him utterly forget Brynhild.
Edzardi thinks two stanzas have been lost after stanza 33, their remains appearing
in stanza 37.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Grimhild merely advises Gunnar to seek Brynhild for his wife, and to have Sigurth
ride with him. <i>Goths</i>: the historical Gunnar (Gundicarius, cf. Introductory Note) was not a Goth, but a
Burgundian, but the word “Goth” was applied in the North without much discrimination
to the southern Germanic peoples.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb350a">[<a href="#pb350a" class="pginternal">350</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.6.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> In the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> Siegfried merely makes himself invisible in order to lend Gunther his strength for
the feats which must be performed in order to win the redoubtable bride. In the northern
version Sigurth and Gunnar change forms, “as Grimhild had taught them how to do.”
The <i>Volsungasaga</i> tells how Sigurth and Gunnar came to Heimir, who told them that to win Brynhild one
must ride through the ring of fire which surrounded her hall (cf. the hall of Mengloth
in <i>Svipdagsmol</i>). Gunnar tries it, but his horse balks; then he mounts Grani, but Grani will not
stir for him. So they change forms, and Sigurth rides Grani through the flames. <i>Oaths</i>: the blood-brotherhood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni makes it impossible for
the brothers to kill him themselves, but they finally get around the difficulty by
inducing their half-brother, Gotthorm (cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 27 and note) to do it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb351a">[<a href="#pb351a" class="pginternal">351</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.6.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> The last half of line 4 is obscure, and the reading is conjectural.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> Something is clearly wrong with stanzas 41–43. In the manuscript the order is 41,
43, 42, which brings two of Gripir’s answers together, followed by two of Sigurth’s
questions. Some editors have arranged the stanzas as in this translation, while others
have interchanged 41 and 43. In any case, Sigurth in stanza 42 asks about the “three
nights” which Gripir has never mentioned. I suspect that lines 3–4 of stanza 41, which
are practically identical with lines 3–4 of stanza 23, got in here by mistake, replacing
two lines which may have run thus: “With thy sword between,   |   three nights thou
sleepest / With her thou winnest   |   for Gunnar’s wife.” The subsequent poems tell
how Sigurth laid his sword Gram between himself and Brynhild.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb352a">[<a href="#pb352a" class="pginternal">352</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.6.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The simultaneous weddings of Sigurth and Gunnar form a memorable feature of the German
tradition as it appears in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, but in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Sigurth marries Guthrun before he sets off with Gunnar to win Brynhild.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> According to the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, Sigurth remembers his oaths to Brynhild almost immediately after his return to Gunnar’s
house. Brynhild, on the other hand, knows nothing until the <span class="pageNum" id="pb353a">[<a href="#pb353a" class="pginternal">353</a>]</span>famous quarrel between herself and Guthrun at the bath (another reminiscence of the
German story), when she taunts Guthrun with Sigurth’s inferiority to Gunnar, and Guthrun
retorts with the statement that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the
flames.
</p>
<p id="n2.6.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.6.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> Brynhild tells Gunnar that Sigurth really possessed her during the three nights when
he slept by her in Gunnar’s form, thus violating his oath. Here again there is a confusion
of two traditions. If Sigurth did not meet Brynhild until after his oath to Gunnar
(cf. note on stanza 13), Brynhild’s charge is entirely false, as she herself admits
in <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>. On the other hand, according to the version in which Sigurth finds Brynhild before
he meets Gjuki’s sons, their union was not only completed, but she had by him a daughter,
Aslaug, whom she leaves in Heimir’s charge before going to become Gunnar’s wife. This
is the <i>Volsungasaga</i> version, and thus the statement Brynhild makes to Gunnar, as a result of which Sigurth
is slain, is quite true.

<p class="first">The <i>Reginsmol</i> immediately follows the <i>Gripisspo</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, and in addition stanzas 1, 2, 6, and 18 are quoted in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, and stanzas 13–26 in the <i>Nornageststhattr</i>. In no instance is the title of the poem stated, and in <i>Regius</i> there stands before the introductory prose, very faintly written, what appears to
be “Of Sigurth.” As a result, various titles have been affixed to it, the two most
often used being “the Ballad of Regin” and “the First Lay of Sigurth Fafnisbane.”
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is by no means clear that the compiler of the Eddic collection
regarded this or either of the two following poems, the <i>Fafnismol</i> and the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, as separate and distinct poems at all. There are no specific titles given, and the
prose notes link the three poems in a fairly consecutive whole. Furthermore, the prose
passage introducing the <i>Reginsmol</i> connects directly with <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i>, and only the insertion of the <i>Gripisspo</i> at this point, which may well have been done by some stupid copyist, breaks the continuity
of the story.
</p>
<p>For convenience I have here followed the usual plan of dividing this material into
distinct parts, or poems, but I greatly doubt if this division is logically sound.
The compiler seems, rather, to have undertaken to set down the story of Sigurth in
consecutive form, making use of all the verse with which he was familiar, and which,
by any stretch of the imagination, could be made to fit, filling up the gaps with
prose narrative notes based on the living oral tradition.
</p>
<p>This view is supported by the fact that not one of the three poems in question, and
least of all the <i>Reginsmol</i>, can possibly be regarded as a unit. For one thing, each of them includes both types
of stanza commonly used in the Eddic poems, and this, notwithstanding the efforts
of Grundtvig and Müllenhoff to prove the contrary, is almost if not quite conclusive
proof that each poem consists of material taken from more than one source. Furthermore,
there is nowhere continuity within the verse itself for more than a very few stanzas.
An analysis of the <i>Reginsmol</i> shows that stanzas 1–4, 6–10, and 12, all in Ljothahattr stanza form, seem to belong
together as fragments of a poem dealing with <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357" class="pginternal">357</a>]</span>Loki’s (not Andvari’s) curse on the gold taken by the gods from Andvari and paid to
Hreithmar, together with Hreithmar’s death at the hands of his son, Fafnir, as the
first result of this curse. Stanza 5, in Fornyrthislag, is a curse on the gold, here
ascribed to Andvari, but the only proper name in the stanza, <i>Gust</i>, is quite unidentifiable, and the stanza may originally have had to do with a totally
different story. Stanza 11, likewise in Fornyrthislag, is merely a father’s demand
that his daughter rear a family to avenge his death; there is nothing in it to link
it necessarily with the dying Hreithmar. Stanzas 13–18, all in Fornyrthislag, give
Regin’s welcome to Sigurth (stanzas 13–14), Sigurth’s announcement that he will avenge
his father’s death on the sons of Hunding before he seeks any treasure (stanza 15),
and a dialogue between a certain Hnikar, who is really Othin, and Regin, as the latter
and Sigurth are on the point of being shipwrecked. This section (stanzas 13–18) bears
a striking resemblance to the Helgi lays, and may well have come originally from that
cycle. Next follows a passage in Ljothahattr form (stanzas 19–22 and 24–25) in which
Hnikar-Othin gives some general advice as to lucky omens and good conduct in battle;
the entire passage might equally well stand in the <i>Hovamol</i>, and I suspect that it originally came from just such a collection of wise saws.
Inserted in this passage is stanza 23, in Fornyrthislag, likewise on the conduct of
battle, with a bit of tactical advice included. The “poem” ends with a single stanza,
in Fornyrthislag, simply stating that the bloody fight is over and that Sigurth fought
well—a statement equally applicable to any part of the hero’s career.
</p>
<p>Finnur Jonsson has divided the <i>Reginsmol</i> into two poems, or rather into two sets of fragments, but this, as the foregoing
analysis has indicated, does not appear to go nearly far enough. It accords much better
with the facts to assume that the compiler of the collection represented by the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, having set out to tell the story of Sigurth, took his verse fragments pretty much
wherever he happened to find them. In this connection, it should be remembered that
in the fluid state of oral tradition poems, fragments, and stanzas passed readily
and frequently from one story to another. Tradition, never critical, doubtless connected
with the Sigurth story much verse that never originated there.
</p>
<p>If the entire passage beginning with the prose <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i>, and, except for the <i>Gripisspo</i>, including the <i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i>, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, be regarded as a highly uncritical <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358" class="pginternal">358</a>]</span>piece of compilation, rendered consecutive by the compiler’s prose narrative, its
difficulties are largely smoothed away; any other way of looking at it results in
utterly inconclusive attempts to reconstruct poems some of which quite possibly never
existed.
</p>
<p>The twenty-six stanzas and accompanying prose notes included under the heading of
<i>Reginsmol</i> belong almost wholly to the northern part of the Sigurth legend; the mythological
features have no counterpart in the southern stories, and only here and there is there
any betrayal of the tradition’s Frankish home. The story of Andvari, Loki, and Hreithmar
is purely Norse, as is the concluding section containing Othin’s counsels. If we assume
that the passage dealing with the victory over Hunding’s sons belongs to the Helgi
cycle (cf. introductory notes to <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i> and <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>), there is very little left to reflect the Sigurth tradition proper.

<p class="first" id="prose2.7">Sigurth went to Hjalprek’s stud and chose for himself a horse, who thereafter was
called Grani. At that time Regin, the son of Hreithmar, was come to Hjalprek’s home;
he was more ingenious than all other men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, fierce
and skilled in magic. Regin undertook Sigurth’s bringing up and teaching, and loved
him much. He told Sigurth of his forefathers, and also of this: that once Othin and
Hönir and Loki had come to Andvari’s waterfall, and in the fall were many fish. Andvari
was a dwarf, who had dwelt long in the waterfall in the shape of a pike, and there
he got his food. “Otr was the name of a brother of ours,” said Regin, “who often went
into the fall in the shape of an otter; he had caught a salmon, and sat on the high
bank eating it with his eyes shut. Loki threw a stone at him and killed him; the gods
thought they had had great good luck, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359" class="pginternal">359</a>]</span>stripped the skin off the otter. That same evening they sought a night’s lodging at
Hreithmar’s house, and showed their booty. Then we seized them, and told them, as
ransom for their lives, to fill the otter skin with gold, and completely cover it
outside as well with red gold. Then they sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron
and got her net, and went then to Andvari’s fall and cast the net in front of the
pike, and the pike leaped into the net.” Then Loki said:

<p id="n2.7.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> Stanzas 3–4 may well be fragments of some other poem. Certainly Loki’s question does
not fit the situation, and the passage looks like an extract from some such poem as
<i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. In <i>Regius</i> the phrase “Loki spake” stands in the middle of line 1.

<p><i><a href="#prose2.7.4" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Snorri says Andvari’s ring had the power to create new gold. In this it resembled
Baldr’s ring, Draupnir; cf. <i>Skirnismol</i>, 21 and note.

<p id="n2.7.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> This stanza apparently comes from a different source from stanzas 1–4 (or 1–2 if
3–4 are interpolated) and 6–10; cf. Introductory Note. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Andvari lays his curse particularly on the ring. <i>Gust</i>: possibly a name for Andvari himself, or for an earlier possessor of the treasure.
<i>Brothers twain</i>: Fafnir and Regin. <i>Heroes eight</i>: the word “eight” may easily have been substituted for something like “all” to make
the stanza fit the case; the “eight” in question are presumably Sigurth, Gotthorm,
Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Erp, Sorli and Hamther, all of whom are slain in the course of
the story. But the stanza may originally not have referred to Andvari’s treasure at
all.

<p id="n2.7.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza, introducing it, as here, with “Then Loki said” in the
prose. <i>Regius</i> omits this phrase, but inserts “said Loki” in line 1.

<p id="n2.7.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> The word translated “maid” in line 2 is obscure, and “gold” may be meant. Apparently,
however, the reference is to the fight between Sigurth and the sons of Gjuki over
Brynhild. The manuscript does not name the speaker, and many editions assign this
stanza to Hreithmar.
</p>
<p id="n2.7.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The manuscript includes “said Hreithmar” (abbreviated) in the middle of line 1, and

<p id="n2.7.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Hreithmar’s daughters do not appear elsewhere. It has been suggested that originally
stanza 10 was followed by one in which Lofnheith lamented her inability to avenge
her father, as she was married and had no son.
</p>
<p id="n2.7.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Apparently an interpolation (cf. Introductory Note). Vigfusson tries to reconstruct
lines 2 and 4 to fit the Ljothahattr rhythm, but without much success. Hreithmar urges
his daughter, as she has no sons, to bear a daughter who, in turn, will have a son
to avenge his great-grandfather. Grundtvig worked out an ingenious theory to fit this
stanza, making Sigurth’s grandfather, Eylimi, the husband of Lyngheith’s daughter,
but there is absolutely no evidence to support this. The stanza may have nothing to
do with Hreithmar.

<p id="n2.7.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.7.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> This and the following stanza may be out of place here, really belonging, together
with their introductory prose sentence, in the opening prose passage, following the
first sentence describing Regin. Certainly they seem to relate to Regin’s first meeting
with Sigurth. Stanzas 13–26, interspersed with prose, are quoted in the <i>Nornageststhattr</i>. Stanzas 13–18 may be the remnants of a lost poem belonging to the Helgi cycle (cf.
Introductory Note). <i>Hardy wolf</i>: warrior, i.e., Sigurth.

the many reasons for believing that stanzas 13–18 belonged originally to the Helgi
cycle. <i>The threads</i>, etc.: another link with Helgi; cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 3–4. As Helgi was likewise regarded as a son of Sigmund, stanzas 13–14 would fit
him just as well as Sigurth.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.7.14" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Gnitaheith</i>: cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 11 and note. <i>Fear-helm</i>: the word “ægis-hjalmr,” which occurs both here and in <i>Fafnismol</i>, suggests an extraordinarily interesting, and still disputed, question of etymology.

for Sigmund.

him as readily as if he had not already been killed long before by Helgi. But, as
has been seen, it was nothing for a man to be killed in two or three different ways.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The so-called <i>Fafnismol</i>, contained in full in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, where it immediately follows the <i>Reginsmol</i> without any indication of a break, is quoted by Snorri in the <i>Gylfaginning</i> (stanza 13) and the <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> (stanzas 32 and 33), and stanzas 6, 3, and 4 appear in the <i>Sverrissaga</i>. Although the <i>Volsungasaga</i> does not actually quote any of the stanzas, it gives a very close prose parallel
to the whole poem in chapters 18 and 19.
</p>
<p>The general character of the <i>Fafnismol</i>, and its probable relation to the <i>Reginsmol</i> and the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, have been discussed in the introductory note to the <i>Reginsmol</i>. While it is far more nearly a unit than the <i>Reginsmol</i>, it shows many of the same characteristics. It has the same mixture of stanza forms,
although in this case only nine stanzas (32–33, 35–36 and 40–44) vary from the normal
Ljothahattr measure. It shows, though to a much less marked extent, the same tendency
to introduce passages from extraneous sources, such as the question-and-answer passage
in stanzas 11–15. At the same time, in this instance it is quite clear that one distinct
poem, including probably stanzas 1–10, 16–23, 25–31, and 34–39, underlay the compilation
which we here have. This may, perhaps, have been a long poem (not, however, the “Long”
Sigurth Lay; see introductory note to <i>Brot af Sigurtharkvithu</i>) dealing with the Regin-Fafnir-Sigurth-Brynhild story, and including, besides most
of the <i>Fafnismol</i>, stanzas 1–4 and 6–11 of the <i>Reginsmol</i> and part of the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, together with much that has been lost. The original poem may, on the other hand,
have confined itself to the Fafnir episode.
</p>
<p>In any case, and while the extant <i>Fafnismol</i> can be spoken of as a distinct poem far more justly than the <i>Reginsmol</i>, there is still no indication that the compiler regarded it as a poem by itself.
His prose notes run on without a break, and the verses simply cover a dramatic episode
in Sigurth’s early life. The fact that the work of compilation has been done more
intelligently than in the case of the <i>Reginsmol</i> seems to have resulted chiefly from the compiler’s having been familiar with longer
consecutive verse passages dealing with the Fafnir episode. <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371" class="pginternal">371</a>]</span>The <i>Reginsmol</i> is little more than a clumsy mosaic, but in the <i>Fafnismol</i> it is possible to distinguish between the main substance of the poem and the interpolations.
</p>
<p>Here, as in the <i>Reginsmol</i>, there is very little that bespeaks the German origin of the Sigurth story. Sigurth’s
winning of the treasure is in itself undoubtedly a part of the earlier southern legend,
but the manner in which he does it is thoroughly Norse. Moreover, the concluding section,
which points toward the finding of the sleeping Brynhild, relates entirely to the
northern Valkyrie, the warrior-maiden punished by Othin, and not at all to the southern
Brynhild the daughter of Buthli. The <i>Fafnismol</i> is, however, sharply distinguished from the <i>Reginsmol</i> by showing no clear traces of the Helgi tradition, although a part of the bird song
(stanzas 40–44, in Fornyrthislag form, as distinct from the body of the poem) sounds
suspiciously like the bird passage in the beginning of the <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>. Regarding the general relations of the various sets of traditions in shaping the
story of Sigurth, see the introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>Fafnismol</i>, together with a part of the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, has indirectly become the best known of all the Eddic poems, for the reason that
Wagner used it, with remarkably little change of outline, as the basis for his “Siegfried.”</p>

<p class="first" id="prose2.8">Sigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir
made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and
took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and
it ran down from above on Sigurth’s head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench,
then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372" class="pginternal">372</a>]</span>to the heart. Fafnir writhed and struck out with his head and tail. Sigurth leaped

<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.8" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The prose follows the concluding prose passage of the <i>Reginsmol</i> without any interruption; the heading “Of Fafnir’s Death” is written in the manuscript
very faintly just before stanza 1. <i>Gnitaheith</i>: cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 11 and note. <i>Fafnir</i>: Regin’s brother: cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose after stanza 14. <i>Venom</i>: in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb372a">[<a href="#pb372a" class="pginternal">372</a>]</span>it was the blood, and not the venom, that poured down on Sigurth’s head. Sigurth was
much worried about this danger, and before he dug the trench asked Regin what would
happen if the dragon’s blood overcame him. Regin thereupon taunted him with cowardice
(Sigurth refers to this taunt in stanza 30, but the stanza embodying it has disappeared).
After Sigurth had dug his trench, an old man (Othin, of course) appeared and advised
him to dig other trenches to carry off the blood, which he did, thereby escaping harm.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The first line in the original, as here, is unusually long, but dramatically very
effective on that account.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscript, though they seem originally
to have been indicated in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb373a">[<a href="#pb373a" class="pginternal">373</a>]</span>margin for stanzas 3–30. The last two lines of stanza 3 are missing in the manuscript,
with no gap indicated, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> prose paraphrase indicates that something was omitted, and the lines here given are
conjecturally reconstructed from this paraphrase.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Line 4, utterly obscure in the manuscript, is guesswork<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd32e25272">.</span>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb374a">[<a href="#pb374a" class="pginternal">374</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.8.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Fafnir here refers to the fact that Hjordis, mother of the still unborn Sigurth,
was captured by Alf after Sigmund’s death; cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i>, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Stanzas 11–15 are probably interpolated, and come from <span class="pageNum" id="pb375a">[<a href="#pb375a" class="pginternal">375</a>]</span>a poem similar to <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>. <i>The headland</i>: Fafnir is apparently quoting proverbs; this one seems to mean that disaster (“the
fate of the Norns”) awaits when one rounds the first headland (i.e., at the beginning
of life’s voyage, in youth). The third line is a commentary on obstinate rashness.
The <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrases stanzas 11–15 throughout.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>Norns</i>: cf. stanza 13 and note. Sigurth has no possible interest in knowing what Norns are
helpful in childbirth, but interpolations were seldom logical.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Snorri quotes this stanza. There were minor Norns, or fates, in addition to the three
great Norns, regarding whom cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 20. <i>Dvalin</i>: chief of the dwarfs; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 14.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb376a">[<a href="#pb376a" class="pginternal">376</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.8.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> <i>Surt</i>: ruler of the fire world; the reference is to the last great battle. <i>Sword-sweat</i>: blood.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> <i>Oskopnir</i> (“Not-Made”): apparently another name for Vigrith, which is named in <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>, 18, as the final battle-ground. <i>Bilrost</i> (or Bifrost): the rainbow bridge which breaks beneath Surt’s followers; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 29 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> With this stanza Fafnir returns to the situation. <i>Fear-helm</i>: regarding the “ægis-hjalmr” cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose after stanza 14 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb377a">[<a href="#pb377a" class="pginternal">377</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.8.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> Lines 3–4 do not appear in the manuscript, and no gap is indicated; they are here
conjecturally paraphrased from the prose passage in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> It has been suggested that this stanza is spurious, and that stanza 21 ought to follow
stanza 22. Lines 3–4, abbreviated in the manuscript, are identical with lines 3–4
of stanza 9. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase in place of these two lines makes <span class="pageNum" id="pb378a">[<a href="#pb378a" class="pginternal">378</a>]</span>Fafnir say: “For it often happens that he who gets a deadly wound yet avenges himself.”
It is quite likely that two stanzas have been lost.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> The <i>Volsungasaga</i> places its paraphrase of this stanza between those of stanzas 15 and 16.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> Line 2 is probably spurious, but it is a phrase typical of such poems as <i>Grimnismol</i> or <i>Vafthruthnismol</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> <i>Gram</i>: Sigurth’s sword; cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose after 14.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb379a">[<a href="#pb379a" class="pginternal">379</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.8.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> In the manuscript stanzas 26–29 stand after stanza 31, which fails to make clear
sense; they are here rearranged in accordance with the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase.
</p>
<p id="n2.8.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.28" class="pginternal">28–29</a>.</span> Almost certainly interpolated from some such poem as the <i>Hovamol</i>. Even the faithful <i>Volsungasaga</i> fails to paraphrase stanza 29.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb380a">[<a href="#pb380a" class="pginternal">380</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.8.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Something has evidently been lost before this stanza. Sigurth clearly refers to Regin’s
reproach when he was digging the trench (cf. note on introductory prose), but the
poem does not give such a passage.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.8.30" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Rithil</i> (“Swift-Moving”): Snorri calls the sword Refil (“Serpent”).
</p>
<p id="n2.8.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> That the birds’ stanzas come from more than one source <span class="pageNum" id="pb381a">[<a href="#pb381a" class="pginternal">381</a>]</span>is fairly apparent, but whether from two or from three or more is uncertain. It is
also far from clear how many birds are speaking. The manuscript numbers II, III, and
IV in the margin with numerals; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> makes a different bird speak each time. There are almost as many guesses as there
are editions. I suspect that in the original poem there was one bird, speaking stanzas
34 and 37. Stanza 38 is little more than a repetition of stanza 34, and may well have
been a later addition. As for the stanzas in Fornyrthislag (32–33 and 35–36), they
apparently come from another poem, in which several birds speak (cf. “we sisters”
in stanza 35). This may be the same poem from which stanzas 40–44 were taken, as well
as some of the Fornyrthislag stanzas in the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>.

<p id="n2.8.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.8.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> Neither the manuscript nor any of the editions suggest the existence of more than
one bird in stanzas 40–44. It seems to me, however, that there are not only two birds,
but two distinct stories. Stanzas 40–41 apply solely to Guthrun, and suggest that
Sigurth will go straight to Gunnar’s hall. Stanzas 42–44, on the other hand, apply
solely to Brynhild, and indicate that Sigurth will find her before he visits the Gjukungs.
The confusion which existed between these two versions of the story, and which involved
a fundamental difference in the final working out of Brynhild’s revenge, is commented
on in the note on <i>Gripisspo</i>, 13. In the present passage it is possible that two birds are speaking, each reflecting
one version of the story; it seems even more likely that one speech or the other (40–41
or 42–44) reflects the original form of the narrative, the other having been added,
either later or from another poem. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> the whole passage is condensed into a few words by one bird: “Wiser were it if he
should then ride up on Hindarfjoll, where Brynhild sleeps, and there would he get
much wisdom.” The Guthrun-bird does not appear at all.

following stanza 4 of the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> he specifically states that this was the Valkyrie’s name. Editors, until recently,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb385a">[<a href="#pb385a" class="pginternal">385</a>]</span>have followed him in this error, failing to recognize that “sigrdrifa” was simply
an epithet for Brynhild. It is from this blunder that the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> takes its name. Brynhild’s dual personality as a Valkyrie and as the daughter of
Buthli has made plenty of trouble, but the addition of a second Valkyrie in the person
of the supposed “Sigrdrifa” has made still more.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, which immediately follows the <i>Fafnismol</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> without any indication of a break, and without separate title, is unquestionably
the most chaotic of all the poems in the Eddic collection. The end of it has been
entirely lost, for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from <i>Regius</i>, the gap coming after the first line of stanza 29 of this poem. That stanza has been
completed, and eight more have been added, from much later paper manuscripts, but
even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity.
</p>
<p>Properly speaking, however, the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler
of the collection has left for us, and which, in much the same general form, seems
to have lain before the authors of the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted, is not a poem at all. Even its customary
title is an absurd error. The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet
“sigrdrifa,” rightly applied to Brynhild as a “bringer of victory,” was a proper name
has already been explained and commented on (note on <i>Fafnismol</i>, 44). Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem, which it emphatically
is not, it is certainly not the “Ballad of Sigrdrifa” which it is commonly called.
“Ballad of Brynhild” would be a sufficiently suitable title, and I have here brought
the established name “Sigrdrifumol” into accord with this by translating the epithet
instead of treating it as a proper name.
</p>
<p>Even apart from the title, however, the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem, nor is there any indication that
the compiler did so regard it. Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding
section, and of the material which followed it on those missing pages, we can yet
see that the process which began with the prose <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i>, and which, interrupted by the insertion of the <i>Gripisspo</i>, went on through the <i>Reginsmol</i> and the <i>Fafnismol</i>, continued through as much of the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> as is left to us. In other words, the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed
prose and verse, using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to
its origin, and filling in the gaps with his own prose. <i>Fra <span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387" class="pginternal">387</a>]</span>Dautha Sinfjotla</i>, <i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i>, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> are essentially a coherent unit, but one of the compiler’s making only; they represent
neither one poem nor three distinct poems, and the divisions and titles which have
been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading.
</p>
<p>The <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork. It is most unlikely
that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time;
little by little, through a process of accretion and also, unluckily, through one
of elimination, the material grew into its present shape. Certainly the basis of it
is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth, but of this original poem
only five stanzas (2–4 and 20–21) can be identified with any degree of confidence.
To these five stanzas should probably, however, be added some, if not all, of the
passage (stanzas 6–12) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes. These stanzas
of rune-lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources, including stanza
5, in which a magic draught is administered (not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth),
the curious rune-chant in stanzas 15–17, and stanzas 13–14 and 18–19. Beginning with
stanza 22, and running to the end of the fragment (stanza 37), is a set of numbered
counsels closely resembling the <i>Loddfafnismol</i> (<i>Hovamol</i>, stanzas 111–138), which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild. Even
in this passage there are probably interpolations (stanzas 25, 27, 30, 34, and 36).
Finally, and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth-Brynhild
poem, is stanza 1, sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas 2–4 and
20–21. Many critics argue that stanzas 6–10 of <i>Helreith Brynildar</i> belonged originally to the same poem as stanza 1 of the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, then, must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments, most of them originally
having no relation to the main subject. All of the story, the dialogue and the characterization
are embodied in stanzas 1–4 and 20–21 and in the prose notes accompanying the first
four stanzas; all of the rest might equally well (or better) be transferred to the
<i>Hovamol</i>, where its character entitles it to a place. Yet stanzas 2–4 are as fine as anything
in Old Norse poetry, and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that
Wagner constructed much of the third act of “Siegfried.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388" class="pginternal">388</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition
(cf. introductory note to the <i>Gripisspo</i>). Brynhild, here disguised by the annotator as “Sigrdrifa,” appears simply as a battle-maid
and supernatural dispenser of wisdom; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli
and the rival of Guthrun. There is, however, so little of the “poem” which can definitely
be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying
narrative substance.
</p>
<p>The nature and condition of the material have made editorial conjectures and emendations
very numerous, and as most of the guesses are neither conclusive nor particularly
important, only a few of them are mentioned in the notes.</p>

On the mountain he saw a great light, as if fire were burning, and the glow reached
up to heaven. And when he came thither, there stood a tower of shields, and above
it was a banner. Sigurth went into the shield-tower, and saw that a man lay there
sleeping with all his war-weapons. First he took the helm from his head, and then
he saw that it was a woman. The mail-coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh.
Then he cut the mail-coat from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389" class="pginternal">389</a>]</span>head-opening downward, and out to both the arm-holes. Then he took the mail-coat from

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.9" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The introductory prose follows without break the prose concluding the <i>Fafnismol</i>, the point of division being arbitrary and not agreed upon by all editors. <i>Hindarfjoll</i>: cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, 42 and note. <i>Franks</i>: this does not necessarily mean that Sigurth was on his way to the Gjukungs’ home,
for Sigmund had a kingdom in the land of the Franks (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i>). <i>Shields</i>: the annotator probably drew the notion of the shield-tower from the reference in
<i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, 9. The flame-girt tower was not uncommon; cf. Mengloth’s hall in <i>Svipdagsmol</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb389a">[<a href="#pb389a" class="pginternal">389</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> This stanza, and the two lines included in the prose after stanza 4, and possibly
stanza 5 as well, evidently come from a different poem from stanzas 2–4. Lines 3–4
in the original are obscure, though the general meaning is clear.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.9.1" class="pginternal">Prose</a></i> (after stanza 1). In the manuscript stanza 4 stands before this prose note and stanzas
2–3. The best arrangement of the stanzas seems to be the one here given, following
Müllenhoff’s suggestion, but the prose note is out of place anywhere. The first sentence
of it ought to follow stanza 4 and immediately precede the next prose note; the second
sentence ought to precede stanza 5.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Sons of day</i>: the spirits of light. <i>The daughter of night</i> (Not), according to Snorri, was Jorth (Earth).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb390a">[<a href="#pb390a" class="pginternal">390</a>]</span></p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.9.4" class="pginternal">Prose</a></i> (after stanza 4). <i>Sigrdrifa</i>: on the error whereby this epithet, “victory-bringer,” became a proper name cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, 44 and note. <i>Hjalmgunnar</i>: in <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i> (stanza 8) he is called a king of the Goths, which means little; of him and his adversary,
<i>Agnar</i>, we know nothing beyond what is told here. The two lines quoted apparently come from
the same poem as stanza 1; the two first lines of the stanza have been reconstructed
from the prose thus: “Hjalmgunnar was one,   |   the hoary king, / And triumph to
him   |   had Heerfather promised.” A few editions insert in this prose passage stanzas
7–10 of <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, which may or may not have belonged originally to this poem.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb391a">[<a href="#pb391a" class="pginternal">391</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> This stanza is perhaps, but by no means surely, from the same poem as stanza 1. <i>Tree of battle</i>: warrior. <i>Runes</i>: the earliest runes were not letters, but simply signs supposed to possess magic
power; out of them developed the “runic alphabet.”
</p>
<p id="n2.9.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Stanzas 6–12 give a list of runes which probably had no original connection with
the Brynhild-Sigurth story. <i>Tyr</i>: the sword-god (cf. <i>Hymiskvitha</i>, 4 and note); “tyr” is also the name of a rune which became “T.”
</p>
<p id="n2.9.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Regius</i> gives only lines 1–6; lines 7–8 are added from <i>Volsungasaga</i>. <i>Lies</i>, etc.: a guest on his arrival received a draught of ale from the hands of his host’s
wife, and it was to prevent this draught from bewitching him that the runes were recommended.
<i>Need</i>: the word “nauth,” meaning “need,” is also the name of the rune which became “N.”
<i>Leek</i>: leeks were long supposed to have the power of counteracting poison or witchcraft.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb392a">[<a href="#pb392a" class="pginternal">392</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>Sail-steeds</i>: ships.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> <i>Branch-runes</i>: runes cut in the bark of trees. Such runes were believed to transfer sickness from
the invalid to the tree. Some editors, however, have changed “limrunar” (“branch-runes”)
to “lifrunar” (“life-runes”).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb393a">[<a href="#pb393a" class="pginternal">393</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Lines 3–6 look like an accidental addition, replacing two lines now lost. They mean,
apparently, that the man who interweaves his speech with “speech-runes” when he pleads
his case at the “Thing,” or popular tribunal, will not unduly enrage his adversary
in the argument of the case.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Here the list of runes breaks off, though the manuscript indicates no gap, and three
short passages of a different type, though all dealing with runes, follow.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Stanzas 13–14 appear to have come from a passage regarding Othin’s getting of the
runes similar to <i>Hovamol</i>, 139–146. Editors have tried various combinations of the lines in stanzas 12–14.
<i>Hropt</i>: Othin; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 62. <i>The draught</i>, etc.: apparently the reference is to the head of Mim, from which Othin derived his
wisdom in magic (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 47 and note); <i>Heithdraupnir</i> (“Light-Dropper”) and <i>Hoddrofnir</i> (“Treasure-Opener”) seem to be names for Mim.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb394a">[<a href="#pb394a" class="pginternal">394</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> This stanza is clearly in bad shape; perhaps, as the manuscript indicates, a new
stanza, of which most has been lost, should begin with line 3. <i>Brimir</i>: a giant (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 9 and 37); why Othin should have his sword is unknown.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Stanzas 15–17 constitute a wholly distinct rune-chant. Line 1 is unusually long in
the original, as here. <i>Shield</i>: the shield Svalin (“Cooling”) that stands in front of the sun; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 38. <i>Arvak</i> (“Early Walter”) and <i>Alsvith</i> (“All-Swift”): the horses that draw the sun’s car; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 37. <i>Hrungnir</i>: the slayer of the giant Hrungnir was Thor (cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 14 and note), but the line is in bad shape; the name may not be Hrungnir, and “killer”
is a conjectural addition. <i>Sleipnir</i>: Othin’s eight-legged horse; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44 and note. <i>Sledge</i>: perhaps the one mentioned in <i>Grimnismol</i>, 49.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> <i>Bragi</i>: the god of poetry; cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 44 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb395a">[<a href="#pb395a" class="pginternal">395</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> <i>Charms</i>: the wearing of amulets was very common. <i>Gungnir</i>: Othin’s spear, made by the dwarfs, which he occasionally lent to heroes to whom
he granted victory. <i>Grani</i>: Sigurth’s horse; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> has “giantesses’.”
</p>
<p id="n2.9.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> Stanzas 18–19, which editors have freely rearranged, apparently come from another
source than any of the rest. <i>Shaved off</i>: the runes were shaved off by Othin from the wood on which they were carved, and
the shavings bearing them were put into the magic mead. <i>Wanes</i>: cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 21, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> Lines 3, 6, and 7 look like spurious additions, but the whole stanza is chaotic.
<i>Beech-runes</i>: runes carved on beech-trees.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb396a">[<a href="#pb396a" class="pginternal">396</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Stanzas 20–21 are all that remains of the dialogue between Brynhild and Sigurth from
the poem to which stanzas 2–4 belong; cf. Introductory Note. In the intervening lost
stanzas Brynhild has evidently warned Sigurth of the perils that will follow if he
swears loyalty to her; hence the choice to which she here refers. <i>Tree</i>, etc.: warrior. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of either this or the
following stanza; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> names Sigurth before stanza 21.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> It is quite possible that the original poem concluded with two stanzas after this,
paraphrased thus in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>: “Sigurth said: ‘Nowhere is to be found any one wiser than thou, and this I swear,
that I shall have thee for mine, and that thou art after my heart’s desire.’ She answered:
‘I would rather have thee though I might choose among all men.’ And this they bound
between them with oaths.” Stanzas 22–37, which the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrases, may have been introduced at a relatively early time, but can hardly
have formed part of the original poem.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb397a">[<a href="#pb397a" class="pginternal">397</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> With this stanza begins the list of numbered counsels, closely resembling the <i>Loddfafnismol</i> (<i>Hovamol</i>, 111–138), here attributed to Brynhild. That the section originally had anything
to do with Brynhild is more than improbable.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Wolf of his word</i>: oath-destroyer, oath-breaker.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> This chaotic and obscure jumble of lines has been unsuccessfully “improved” by various
editors. It is clearly an interpolation, meaning, in substance: “It is dangerous to
keep silent too long, as men may think you a coward; but if any one taunts <span class="pageNum" id="pb398a">[<a href="#pb398a" class="pginternal">398</a>]</span>you falsely because of your silence, do not argue with him, but the next morning kill
him as proof that he is a liar.”
</p>
<p id="n2.9.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Probably another interpolation.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> <i>Silver of kinship</i>: the passage is doubtful, but apparently it means the “marriage-price” for which
a bride was “bought.”
</p>
<p id="n2.9.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> Line 1 comes at the end of the thirty-second leaf of <i>Regius</i>, and whatever further was contained in that manuscript has vanished <span class="pageNum" id="pb399a">[<a href="#pb399a" class="pginternal">399</a>]</span>with the lost eight-leaf folio (cf. Introductory Note). The rest of stanza 29, and
stanzas 30–37, are added from later paper manuscripts, which were undoubtedly copied
from an old parchment, though probably not from the complete <i>Regius</i>. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrases these additional stanzas.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Probably an interpolation.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> The meaning is that it is better to go forth to battle than to stay at home and be
burned to death. Many a Norse warrior met his death in this latter way; the burning
of the house in the <i>Njalssaga</i> is the most famous instance.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> Probably an interpolation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb400a">[<a href="#pb400a" class="pginternal">400</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.9.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> Lines 3–4 are probably interpolated. <i>Race of wolves</i>: family of a slain foe.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Probably an interpolation.
</p>
<p id="n2.9.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.9.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Lines 3–4 may well have come from the old Sigurth-Brynhild poem, like stanzas 2–4
and 20–21, being inserted here, where they do not fit particularly well, in place
of the two lines with which the eleventh counsel originally ended. Perhaps they formed
part of the stanza of warning which evidently preceded Brynhild’s speech in stanza
20. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> they are paraphrased at the end of Brynhild’s long speech of advice (stanzas 20–37),
and are immediately followed by the prose passage given in the note on stanza 21.
It seems likely, therefore, <span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401" class="pginternal">401</a>]</span>that the paper manuscripts have preserved all of the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> which was contained in the lost section of <i>Regius</i>, with the possible exception of these two concluding stanzas, and these may very
well have been given only in the form of a prose note, though it is practically certain
that at one time they existed in verse form.

<p class="first">The gap of eight leaves in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> (cf. introductory note to the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>) is followed by a passage of twenty stanzas which is evidently the end of a longer
poem, the greater part of it having been contained in the lost section of the manuscript.
There is here little question of such a compilation as made up the so-called <i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i>, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>; the extant fragment shows every sign of being part of a poem which, as it stood
in the manuscript, was a complete and definite unit. The end is clearly marked; the
following poem, <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i> I, carries a specific heading in the manuscript, so that there is no uncertainty
as to where the fragment closes.
</p>
<p>It seems altogether likely that the twenty stanzas thus remaining are the end of a
poem entitled <i>Sigurtharkvitha</i> (Lay of Sigurth), and, more specifically, the “Long” Lay of Sigurth. The extant and
complete Sigurth lay, a relatively late work, is referred to by the annotator as the
“Short” Lay of Sigurth, which, of course, presupposes the existence of a longer poem
with the same title. As the “short” lay is one of the longest poems in the whole collection
(seventy stanzas), it follows that the other one must have been considerably more
extensive in order to have been thus distinguished by its length. It may be guessed,
then, that not less than eighty or a hundred stanzas, and possibly more, of the “Long”
Lay of Sigurth have been lost with the missing pages of <i>Regius</i>.
</p>
<p>The narrative, from the point at which the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> breaks off to that at which the Brot takes it up, is given with considerable detail
in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>. In this prose narrative four stanzas are quoted, and one of them is specifically
introduced with the phrase: “as is told in the Lay of Sigurth.” It is possible, but
most unlikely, that the entire passage paraphrases this poem alone; such an assumption
would give the Lay of Sigurth not less than two hundred and fifty stanzas (allowing
about fifteen stanzas to each of the missing pages), and moreover there are inconsistencies
in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> narrative suggesting that different and more or less conflicting poems were used
as sources. The chances are that the “Long” Lay of Sigurth <span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403" class="pginternal">403</a>]</span>filled approximately the latter half of the lost section of the manuscript, the first
half including poems of which the only trace is to be found in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> prose paraphrase and in two of the stanzas therein quoted.
</p>
<p>The course of the <i>Volsungasaga’s</i> story from the <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> to the <i>Brot</i> is, briefly, as follows. After leaving the Valkyrie, Sigurth comes to the dwelling
of Heimir, Brynhild’s brother-in-law, where he meets Brynhild and they swear oaths
of fidelity anew (the <i>Volsungasaga</i> is no more lucid with regard to the Brynhild-Sigrdrifa confusion than was the annotator
of the poems). Then the scene shifts to the home of the Gjukungs. Guthrun, Gjuki’s
daughter, has a terrifying dream, and visits Brynhild to have it explained, which
the latter does by foretelling pretty much everything that is going to happen; this
episode was presumably the subject of a separate poem in the lost section of the manuscript.
Guthrun returns home, and Sigurth soon arrives, to be made enthusiastically welcome.
Grimhild, mother of Gunnar and Guthrun, gives him a magic draught which makes him
forget all about Brynhild, and shortly thereafter he marries Guthrun.
</p>
<p>Then follows the episode of the winning of Brynhild for Gunnar (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 37 and note). This was certainly the subject of a poem, possibly of the first part
of the “Long” Lay of Sigurth, although it seems more likely that the episode was dealt
with in a separate poem. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> quotes two stanzas describing Sigurth’s triumphant passing through the flames after
Gunnar has failed and the two have changed forms. They run thus:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The fire raged,   |   the earth was rocked,
</p>
<p class="line">The flames leaped high   |   to heaven itself;
</p>
<p class="line">Few were the hardy   |   heroes would dare
</p>
<p class="line">To ride or leap   |   the raging flames.</p>
</div>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sigurth urged Grani   |   then with his sword,
</p>
<p class="line">The fire slackened   |   before the hero,
</p>
<p class="line">The flames sank low   |   for the greedy of fame,
</p>
<p class="line">The armor flashed   |   that Regin had fashioned.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After Sigurth has spent three nights with Brynhild, laying his sword between them
(cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 41 and note), he and Gunnar return home, while Brynhild goes to the dwelling of
her brother-in-law, Heimir, and makes ready for her marriage with Gunnar, <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404" class="pginternal">404</a>]</span>directing Heimir to care for her daughter by Sigurth, Aslaug. The wedding takes place,
to be followed soon after by the quarrel between Guthrun and Brynhild, in which the
former betrays the fact that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the
flames. Brynhild speaks with contempt of Guthrun and her whole family, and the following
stanza, which presumably belongs to the same Sigurth lay as the <i>Brot</i>, is quoted at this point:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sigurth the dragon   |   slew, and that
</p>
<p class="line">Will men recall   |   while the world remains;
</p>
<p class="line">But little boldness   |   thy brother had
</p>
<p class="line">To ride or leap   |   the raging flames.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Gunnar and Sigurth alike try to appease the angry Brynhild, but in vain. After Sigurth
has talked with her, his leaving her hall is described in the following stanza, introduced
by the specific phrase: “as is said in the Lay of Sigurth”:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Forth went Sigurth,   |   and speech he sought not,
</p>
<p class="line">The friend of heroes,   |   his head bowed down;
</p>
<p class="line">Such was his grief   |   that asunder burst
</p>
<p class="line">His mail-coat all   |   of iron wrought.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Brynhild then tells Gunnar that she had given herself wholly to Sigurth before she
had become Gunnar’s wife (the confusion between the two stories is commented on in
the note to <i>Gripisspo</i>, 47), and Gunnar discusses plans of <span class="corr" title="Source: vengance" id="xd32e26626">vengeance</span> with his brother, Hogni. It is at this point that the action of the <i>Brot</i> begins.
</p>
<p>Beginning with this poem, and thence to the end of the cycle, the German features
of the narrative predominate (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n2.10.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The fragment begins with the last words of line 1 (probably line 3 of the stanza).
A few editors ascribe this speech to Gunnar and the next to Brynhild; one reconstruction
of lines 1–2 on this probably false assumption runs: “Why art thou, Brynhild, <span class="pageNum" id="pb405a">[<a href="#pb405a" class="pginternal">405</a>]</span>  |   daughter of Buthli, / Scheming ill   |   with evil counsel?” <i>Hogni</i> (German Hagene): brother of Gunnar and Guthrun.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> A few editors ascribe this speech to Brynhild. Gunnar, if the stanza is his, has
believed Brynhild’s statement regarding Sigurth’s disloyalty to his blood-brother.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> The <i>Volsungasaga</i> quotes a somewhat different version of this stanza, in which the snake is called
“wood-fish” and the third line adds “beer and many things.” Eating snakes and the
flesh of beasts of prey was commonly supposed to induce ferocity. <i>Gotthorm</i>: Grimhild’s son, half-brother to Gunnar. He it is who, not having sworn brotherhood
with Sigurth, does the killing.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza stands between stanzas 11 and 12; most editions have
made the change here indicated. <span class="pageNum" id="pb406a">[<a href="#pb406a" class="pginternal">406</a>]</span><i>South of the Rhine</i>: the definite localization of the action shows how clearly all this part of the story
was recognized in the North as of German origin. <i>Atli</i> (Attila; cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>): the Northern version of the story makes him Brynhild’s brother. His marriage with
Guthrun, and his slaying of her brothers, are told in the Atli poems. Regarding the
manner of Sigurth’s death cf. concluding prose passage and note. Stanza 13 indicates
that after stanza 5 a stanza containing the words of an eagle has been lost.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> One line of this stanza, but it is not clear which, seems to have been lost. <i>The gray horse</i>: Grani.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> Some editions set stanzas 8 and 9 after stanza 11; Sijmons marks them as spurious.
<i>Buthli</i>: cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 19, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> <i>Goths</i>: a generic term for any German race; cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb407a">[<a href="#pb407a" class="pginternal">407</a>]</span>35 and note. <i>Five sons</i>: according to the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Sigurth had only one son, named Sigmund, who was killed at Brynhild’s behest. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i> and <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i> likewise mention only one son. The daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, Svanhild, marries
Jormunrek (Ermanarich).
</p>
<p id="n2.10.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and a few editions
combine it with stanza 13.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Slayer of hosts</i>: warrior (Gunnar). <i>Raven and eagle</i>: cf. note on stanza 5.

<p id="n2.10.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Mogk regards stanzas 16 and 17 as interpolated, but on not very satisfactory grounds.
On the death of Gunnar cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and some editions attach these two lines to
stanza 16. <i>Niflungs</i>: this name (German Nibelungen), meaning “sons of the mist,” seems to have belonged
originally to the race of supernatural beings to which the treasure belonged in the
German version. It was subsequently extended to include the Gjukungs and their Burgundians.
This question, of minor importance in the Norse poems, has evoked an enormous amount
of learned discussion in connection with the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb409a">[<a href="#pb409a" class="pginternal">409</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.10.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>Footprints</i>: the actual mingling of blood in one another’s footprints was a part of the ceremony
of swearing blood-brotherhood, the oath which Gunnar and Sigurth had taken. The fourth
line refers to the fact that Sigurth had won many battles for Gunnar.
</p>
<p id="n2.10.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.10.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Regarding the sword episode cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 41 and note. <i>Wound-staff</i>: sword.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.10.20" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> This prose passage has in the manuscript, written in red, the phrase “Of Sigurth’s
Death” as a heading; there is no break between it and the prose introducing <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, the heading for that poem coming just before stanza 1. This note is of special interest
as an effort at real criticism. The annotator, troubled by the two versions of the
story of Sigurth’s death, feels it incumbent on him not only to point the fact out,
but to cite the authority of “German men” for the form which appears <span class="pageNum" id="pb410a">[<a href="#pb410a" class="pginternal">410</a>]</span>in this poem. The alternative version, wherein Sigurth is slain in bed, appears in
<i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, and <i>Hamthesmol</i>, and also in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, which tells how Gotthorm tried twice to kill Sigurth but was terrified by the brightness
of his eyes, and succeeded only after the hero had fallen asleep. That the annotator
was correct in citing German authority for the slaying of Sigurth in the forest is
shown by the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and the <i>Thithrekssaga</i>. The “old” Guthrun lay is unquestionably <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>.

<p class="first">The <i>First Lay of Guthrun</i>, entitled in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> simply <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i>, immediately follows the remaining fragment of the “long” Sigurth lay in that manuscript.
Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called
<i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i>, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations.
It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary
emotional intensity and dramatic force. None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere,
and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki
who appear in this poem, or Herborg, “queen of the Huns” (stanza 6).

<p>The lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the
story. The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic
peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament
of Sigurth’s wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached
the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, introductory note). We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, and in the poems of the <i>Edda</i> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun. The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are
both laments, one for Sigurth’s death and the other including both that and the lament
over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun
lay and in the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>.
</p>
<p>In their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than the first;
in the prose following the <i>Brot</i> the annotator refers to the “old” Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the
second one in the collection. The shorter and “first” lay, therefore, can scarcely
have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later. The poet
appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza 17, for example, is
a close parallel to stanza 2 of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he
fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412" class="pginternal">412</a>]</span>own. And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the
latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the
entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.
</p>
<p><i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition
to the basic German tradition. Brynhild appears only as Guthrun’s enemy and the cause
of Sigurth’s death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown
to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet’s
than traditional additions to the legend. Regarding the relations of the various elements
in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>.</p>

that she understood the speech of birds. This is a poem about Guthrun.

“Hun” has little definiteness of meaning in the poems, and is frequently applied to

fulfilled is told in the subsequent poems. That desire for Sigurth’s treasure (the
gold cursed by Andvari and Loki) was one of the motives for his murder is indicated
in <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i> (stanza 16), and was clearly a part of the German tradition, as it appears in the
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>.

<p id="n2.11.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.11.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Editors are agreed that this stanza shows interpolations, but differ as to the lines
to reject. Line 4 (literally “every wave of ill-doing drives thee”) is substantially
a proverb, and line 5, with its apparently meaningless reference to “seven” kings,
may easily have come from some other source.
</p>
<p id="n2.11.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.11.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas,
or perhaps three of the lines are later additions. <i>Atli</i>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring
the responsibility for a murder (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i>, 33), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the
poet seems to have gained from <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 32–39. These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein
Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild,
as wife. He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her
that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described
in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> and <i>Gripisspo</i>, 37–39). In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth’s
treasure. <i>Hunnish race</i>: this may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb419a">[<a href="#pb419a" class="pginternal">419</a>]</span>merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in
any way with Atli and his Huns), based on <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the “Hunnish king.” The North was very
much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths,
and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination. On the other hand, it may
refer to Sigurth’s appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege
Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 36). <i>Flame of the snake’s bed</i>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the traditional guardians of treasure,
on which they lay.
</p>
<p><i><a href="#prose2.11.25" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> The manuscript has “Gunnar” in place of “Guthrun,” but this is an obvious mistake;
the entire prose passage is based on <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 14. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> likewise merely paraphrases <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, and nothing further is known of Thora or her father, Hokon, though many inconclusive

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i> is immediately followed in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading “Sigurtharkvitha,” but which
is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i> as the “short” Lay of Sigurth. The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious
length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that
the “long” Sigurth lay, of which the <i>Brot</i> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem. The efforts to reduce
the “short” Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison
with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the
rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.
</p>
<p>Although there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions
are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit.
From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason
that the poet’s object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were
quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful
characterization. The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout,
and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble
the poet at all.
</p>
<p>The material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse
form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic
collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions
which never fully assumed verse form. The fact that he seems to have known and used
the <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces
the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late
as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth. There has
been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on
the reference to glaciers (stanza 8). There is something to be said in favor of Greenland
<span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421" class="pginternal">421</a>]</span>as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to <i>Atlakvitha</i>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically
out of the question.
</p>
<p>The narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements
of the story (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination
as to its source. By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends,
existed throughout the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of
variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n2.12.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Gjuki</i>: father of <i>the brothers twain</i>, Gunnar and Hogni, and of <i>Guthrun</i>. In this version of the story Sigurth goes straight to the home of the Gjukungs after
his victory over the dragon Fafnir, without meeting Brynhild on the way (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 13 and note). <i>Volsung</i>: Sigurth’s grandfather was Volsung; cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note. <i>Oaths</i>: regarding the blood-brotherhood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni cf. <i>Brot</i>, 18 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Brynhild</i>: on the winning of Brynhild by Sigurth in Gunnar’s shape cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 37 and note. The poet here omits details, <span class="pageNum" id="pb422a">[<a href="#pb422a" class="pginternal">422</a>]</span>and in stanzas 32–39 appears a quite different tradition regarding the winning of
Brynhild, which I suspect he had in mind throughout the poem.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Southern hero</i>: Sigurth, whose Frankish origin is seldom wholly lost sight of in the Norse versions
of the story. On the episode of the sword cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 41 and note. Line 3 may well be an interpolation; both lines 4 and 5 have also been
questioned, and some editions combine line 5 with lines 1–3 of stanza 5. <i>Hunnish king</i>: Sigurth, who was, of course, not a king of the Huns, but was occasionally so called
in the later poems owing to the lack of ethnological distinction made by the Norse
poets (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 24 and note).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy
and unsuspecting as Gunnar’s wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 45 and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer
to the version of the story which appears in stanzas 32–39, wherein Brynhild lived
happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was
compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing
<span class="pageNum" id="pb423a">[<a href="#pb423a" class="pginternal">423</a>]</span>Gunnar as Sigurth, her chosen hero (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 24 and note). The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and
many editors combine it with stanza 6.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Brynhild has now discovered the deceit that has been practised on her. That she had
loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza 40) fits well with the version of the story
wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar’s home (the version not used in
this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza 5, but does not accord with
the story of Sigurth’s first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar’s form—an added reason for
believing that the poet in stanzas 5–6 had in mind the story represented by stanzas
32–39. <i>The hero</i>: the manuscript originally had the phrase thus, then corrected it to “though I die,”
and finally crossed out the correction. Many editions have “I.”
</p>
<p id="n2.12.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Perhaps a line is missing after line 3.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> <i>Glacier</i>: a bit of Icelandic (or Greenland) local color.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> Line 1 does not appear in the manuscript, and is based on <span class="pageNum" id="pb424a">[<a href="#pb424a" class="pginternal">424</a>]</span>a conjecture by Bugge. Some editions add line 2 to stanza 8. The manuscript indicates
line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and some editors assume a gap of two lines after
line 4. <i>Hunnish king</i>: cf. stanza 4.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> <i>Lands</i>: Brynhild’s wealth again points to the story represented by stanzas 32–39; elsewhere
she is not spoken of as bringing wealth to Gunnar.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Line 5, or perhaps line 3, may be interpolated.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> <i>The son</i>: the three-year-old son of Sigurth and Guthrun, Sigmund, who was killed at Brynhild’s
behest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb425a">[<a href="#pb425a" class="pginternal">425</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.12.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> This stanza has been the subject of many conjectural emendations. Some editions assume
a gap after line 2, and make a separate stanza of lines 3–7; others mark lines 5–7
as spurious. The stanza seems to have been expanded by repetition. <i>Grief</i> (line 1): the manuscript has “wrath,” involving a metrical error.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> Bugge and Gering transfer lines 4–5 to the beginning of stanza 16, on the basis of
the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase, and assume a gap of one line after line 3. Line 5, which is in the nature
of a stereotyped clause, may well be interpolated.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> After “Buthli” in line 2 the manuscript has “my brother,” apparently a scribal error.
In line 4 the manuscript has “wealth” instead of “love,” apparently with stanza 10
in mind, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase has “love,” and many editors have suspected an error.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Cf. note on stanza 14. After thus adding lines 4–5 of <span class="pageNum" id="pb426a">[<a href="#pb426a" class="pginternal">426</a>]</span>stanza 14 at the beginning of stanza 16, Gering marks line 4 as probably spurious;
others reject both lines 3 and 4 as mere repetitions. <i>Rhine</i>: the Rhine, the sands of which traditionally contained gold, was apparently the original
home of the treasure of the Nibelungs, converted in the North to Andvari’s treasure
(cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, 1–9). That greed for Sigurth’s wealth was one of the motives for his slaying is
indicated likewise in <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 20, and in the German versions of the story.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>We four</i>: if line 1 of stanza 19 is spurious, or the reference therein to “five” is a blunder,
as may well be the case, then the “four” are Sigurth and the three brothers, Gunnar,
Hogni, and Gotthorm. But it may be that the poet had in mind a tradition which, as
in the <i>Thithrekssaga</i>, gave Gjuki a fourth son, in which case the “four” refers only to the four Gjukungs.
<i>Hunnish hero</i>: Sigurth; cf. stanza 4 and note. Some editions put line 4 between lines 1 and 2.
Some add lines 1–2 of stanza 19 to stanza 18, marking them as spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> <i>We five</i>: see note on preceding stanza. Some editors mark <span class="pageNum" id="pb427a">[<a href="#pb427a" class="pginternal">427</a>]</span>lines 1–2 as spurious, and either assume a gap of two lines after line 4 or combine
lines 3–4 with stanza 20. <i>Whence lead the ways</i>: a proverbial expression signifying “whence the trouble comes.”

<p id="n2.12.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. <i>Gotthorm</i> (the name is variously spelt): half-brother of Gunnar and Hogni (cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 27 and note, and <i>Brot</i>, 4 and note). The name is the northern form of Gundomar; a prince of this name is
mentioned in the <i>Lex Burgundionum</i>, apparently as a brother of Gundahari (Gundicarius). In the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> the third brother is called Gernot.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and many editors combine stanza 21 with stanza
22, but it seems likely that not only two lines, but one or more stanzas in addition,
have been lost; cf. <i>Brot</i>, 4, and also the detailed account of the slaying of Sigurth in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, wherein, as here, Sigurth is killed in his bed (cf. stanza 24) and not in the forest.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> Some editions combine lines 3–4 with stanza 23. <i>Gram</i>: <span class="pageNum" id="pb428a">[<a href="#pb428a" class="pginternal">428</a>]</span>Sigurth’s sword (cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose after stanza 14); the word here, however, may not be a proper name, but may
mean “the hero.”
</p>
<p id="n2.12.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> A line may well have been lost from this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Freyr</i>: if the phrase “the friend of Freyr” means anything more than “king” (cf. <i>Rigsthula</i>, 46 etc.), which I doubt, it has reference to the late tradition that Freyr, and
not Othin, was the ancestor of the Volsungs (cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>, 57 and note).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> Müllenhoff thinks this stanza, or at any rate lines 1–2, a later addition based on
stanza 29.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>My son</i>: Sigmund; cf. stanza 12 and note, and also <i>Brot</i>, 9 and note.

<p id="n2.12.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Sigurth means that although Guthrun may have seven sons by a later marriage, none
of them will equal Sigmund, “son of their (i.e., Gunnar’s and Hogni’s) sister.” <i>Thing</i>: council.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Sigurth’s protestation of guiltlessness fits perfectly with the story of his relations
with Brynhild used in this poem, but not, of course, with the alternative version,
used in the <i>Gripisspo</i> and elsewhere, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild before he woos her for Gunnar, and
they have a daughter, Aslaug.
</p>

<p id="n2.12.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> Line 1 may well be a mere expansion of “Gunnar spake.” The manuscript marks line
4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions combine lines 4–5 with stanza
32.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently
refers to the same story represented by stanzas 37–39, which most editors have (I
believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated. As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas
3, 5, 6 and 10, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story
wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli’s
sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli’s representation
that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 24 and note).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker, and some editions add a first line: “Then
Brynhild, daughter   |   of Buthli, spake.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb431a">[<a href="#pb431a" class="pginternal">431</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.12.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> Cf. stanza 5.

</p>
<p id="n2.12.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Some editions place this stanza after stanza 39, on the theory that stanzas 37–39
are interpolated. Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been
marked as spurious. In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli
pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom,
as he rode on <i>Grani</i> and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon’s
slayer. Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary. The oath
to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> Most editors mark stanzas 37–39 as interpolated, but cf. note on stanza 32. Stanza
37 has been variously emended. Lines 4 and 6 look like interpolated repetitions, but
many editors make <span class="pageNum" id="pb432a">[<a href="#pb432a" class="pginternal">432</a>]</span>two stanzas, following the manuscript in beginning a new stanza with line 4. After
line 1 Grundtvig adds: “Son of Buthli,   |   and brother of mine.” After line 6 Bugge
adds: “Not thou was it, Gunnar,   |   who Grani rode, / Though thou my brother   |  
with rings didst buy.” Regarding Brynhild’s wealth cf. stanza 10 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> Brynhild here again appears as a Valkyrie. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning
of a new stanza. Any one of the last three lines may be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> Some editions combine this stanza with lines 4–5 of stanza 38, with lines 1–2 of
stanza 40, or with the whole of stanza 40. <i>The bond</i>: Brynhild thought she was marrying Sigurth, owner of the treasure, whereas she was
being tricked into marrying Gunnar.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb433a">[<a href="#pb433a" class="pginternal">433</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.12.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> At this point there seem to be several omissions. Brynhild’s statement in lines 1–2
seems to refer to the episode, not here mentioned but told in detail in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, of Sigurth’s effort to repair the wrong that has been done her by himself giving
up Guthrun in her favor, an offer which she refuses. The lacuna here suggested, which
is not indicated in the manuscript, may be simply a single line (line 1) or a stanza
or more. After line 2 there is almost certainly a gap of at least one stanza, and
possibly more, in which Brynhild states her determination to die.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Hardly any two editions agree as to the arrangement of the lines in stanzas 42–44.
I have followed the manuscript except in transposing line 4 of stanza 43 to this position
from the place it holds in the manuscript after line 4 of stanza 44. All the other
arrangements involve the rejection of two or more lines as spurious and the assumption
of various gaps. Gering and Sijmons both arrange the lines thus: 42, 1–2; two-line
gap; 43, 3 <span class="pageNum" id="pb434a">[<a href="#pb434a" class="pginternal">434</a>]</span>(marked probably spurious); 44, 1–4; 43–4 (marked probably spurious); 42, 3–4; 43,
1–2.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> Cf. note on preceding stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Cf. note on stanza 42.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> Perhaps the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning
of a new stanza, and after line 4 an added line has been suggested: “She was ever
known   |   for evil thoughts.” On the other hand, line 1, identical with line 1 of
stanza 17, may well be a mere expansion of “Hogni spake,” and line 6 may have been
introduced, with a slight variation, from line 5 of stanza 38. <i>Born again</i>: this looks like a trace of Christian influence (the poem was composed well after
the coming of Christianity to Iceland) in the assumption that if Brynhild killed herself
she could not be “born again” (cf. concluding prose to <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i>).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza; some <span class="pageNum" id="pb435a">[<a href="#pb435a" class="pginternal">435</a>]</span>editions treat lines 1–2 as a separate stanza, and combine lines 3–4 with lines 1–2
of stanza 47. <i>Jewel-bearer</i> (literally “land of jewels”): woman, here Brynhild. <i>Bond-women</i>, etc.: in stanza 69 we learn that five female slaves and eight serfs were killed
to be burned on the funeral pyre, and thus to follow Sigurth in death.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as beginning a stanza, and some editions
treat lines 3–4 as a separate stanza, or combine them with stanza 48.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> Brynhild means, as stanzas 49–51 show, that those of her women who wish to win rewards
must be ready to follow her in death. The word translated “women” in line 1 is conjectural,
but the general meaning is clear enough.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> In place of “as so she spake” in line 1 the manuscript has <span class="pageNum" id="pb436a">[<a href="#pb436a" class="pginternal">436</a>]</span>“of their plans they thought,” which involves a metrical error.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript; many editions place it between lines 3 and 4.
<i>Menja’s wealth</i>: gold; the story of the mill Grotti, whereby the giantesses Menja and Fenja ground
gold for King Frothi, is told in the <i>Grottasongr</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.52"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.52" class="pginternal">52</a>.</span> With this stanza begins Brynhild’s prophesy of what is to befall Gunnar, Guthrun,
Atli, and the many others involved in their fate. Line 3 is a proverbial expression
meaning simply “your troubles are not at an end.”
</p>
<p id="n2.12.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscript; one suggestion for line 2 runs: “Grimhild
shall make her   |   to laugh once <span class="pageNum" id="pb437a">[<a href="#pb437a" class="pginternal">437</a>]</span>more.” Gering suggests a loss of three lines, and joins lines 3–4 with stanza 54.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> Probably a line has been lost from this stanza. Grundtvig adds as a new first line:
“Her shalt thou find   |   in the hall of Half.” Some editions query line 3 as possibly
spurious. <i>Svanhild</i>: the figure of Svanhild is exceedingly old. The name means “Swan-Maiden-Warrior,”
applying to just such mixtures of swan-maiden and Valkyrie as appear in the <i>Völundarkvitha</i>. Originally part of a separate tradition, Svanhild appears first to have been incorporated
in the Jormunrek (Ermanarich) story as the unhappy wife of that monarch, and much
later to have been identified as the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, thus linking
the two sets of legends.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.55"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.55" class="pginternal">55</a>.</span> Line 2 in the original is almost totally obscure. Line 4 should very possibly precede
line 2, while line 5 looks like an unwarranted addition.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.56"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.56" class="pginternal">56</a>.</span> This stanza probably ought to follow stanza 52, as it refers solely to the winning
of Brynhild by Gunnar and Sigurth. Müllenhoff regards stanzas 53–55 as interpolated.
The manuscript indicates no gap after line 3.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb438a">[<a href="#pb438a" class="pginternal">438</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.12.57"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.57" class="pginternal">57</a>.</span> Stanzas 57–58 seem to be the remains of two stanzas, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase follows closely the form here given. Line 3 may well be spurious; line
5 has likewise been questioned. <i>Oddrun</i>: this sister of Atli and Brynhild, known mainly through the <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, is a purely northern addition to the cycle, and apparently one of a relatively late
date. She figures solely by reason of her love affair with Gunnar.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.58"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.58" class="pginternal">58</a>.</span> Possibly two lines have been lost; many editions combine the two remaining lines
with lines 1–3 of stanza 59. Concerning the manner of Gunnar’s death cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.59"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.59" class="pginternal">59</a>.</span> Line 3 may well be spurious, as it is largely repetition. The manuscript has “<span lang="non">sofa</span>” (“sleep”) in place of “<span lang="non">sona</span>” (“sons”), but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase says clearly “sons.” The slaying of Atli by Guthrun in revenge for his
killing of her brothers is told in the two Atli lays. The manuscript marks line 4
as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of
lines 4–5, or else combine them with stanza 60.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.60"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.60" class="pginternal">60</a>.</span> <i>To follow in death</i>: this phrase is not in <i>Regius</i>, but is <span class="pageNum" id="pb439a">[<a href="#pb439a" class="pginternal">439</a>]</span>included in late paper manuscripts, and has been added in most editions.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.61"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.61" class="pginternal">61</a>.</span> <i>Jonak</i>: this king, known only through the <i>Hamthesmol</i> and the stories which, like this one, are based thereon, is another purely northern
addition to the legend. The name is apparently of Slavic origin. He appears solely
as Guthrun’s third husband and the father of Hamther, Sorli, and Erp (cf. introductory
prose to <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.62"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.62" class="pginternal">62</a>.</span> <i>Svanhild</i>: cf. stanza 54 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.63"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.63" class="pginternal">63</a>.</span> <i>Bikki</i>: Svanhild is married to the aged Jormunrek (Ermanarich), but Bikki, one of his followers,
suggests that she is unduly intimate with Jormunrek’s son, Randver. Thereupon Jormunrek
has Randver hanged, and Svanhild torn to pieces by wild horses. Ermanarich’s cruelty
and his barbarous slaying of his wife and son were familiar traditions long before
they became <span class="pageNum" id="pb440a">[<a href="#pb440a" class="pginternal">440</a>]</span>in any way connected with the Sigurth cycle (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>).
</p>
<p id="n2.12.64"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.64" class="pginternal">64</a>.</span> Line 5 is very probably spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.65"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.65" class="pginternal">65</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap; a suggested addition runs “Gold let there be,   |  
and jewels bright.” <i>Fallen slaves</i>: cf. stanzas 66 and 69. <i>Hunnish hero</i>: cf. stanza 4 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.12.66"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.12.66" class="pginternal">66</a>.</span> In place of lines 3–4 the manuscript has one line “Two at his head,   |   and a pair
of hawks”; the addition is made from the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase. The burning or burying of slaves or beasts to accompany their masters
in death was a general custom in the North. The number of slaves indicated in this
stanza does not tally with the one given in stanza 69, wherefore Vigfusson rejects
most of this stanza.

referring to the sword, but it is metrically impossible, and many editions omit it.

the poet here assumes that the gate of Valhall does likewise, but that it will be
kept open for Sigurth’s retinue.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i> immediately follows the “short” Sigurth lay in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, being linked to it by the brief prose note; the heading, “Brynhild’s Ride on Hel-Way,”
stands just before the first stanza. The entire poem, with the exception of stanza
6, is likewise quoted in the <i>Nornageststhattr</i>. Outside of one stanza (No. 11), which is a fairly obvious interpolation, the poem
possesses an extraordinary degree of dramatic unity, and, certain pedantic commentators
notwithstanding, it is one of the most vivid and powerful in the whole collection.
None the less, it has been extensively argued that parts of it belonged originally
to the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>. That it stands in close relation to this poem is evident enough, but it is difficult
to believe that such a masterpiece of dramatic poetry was ever the result of mere
compilation. It seems more reasonable to regard the <i>Helreith</i>, with the exception of stanza 11 and allowing for the loss of two lines from stanza
6, as a complete and carefully constructed unit, based undoubtedly on older poems,
but none the less an artistic creation in itself.
</p>
<p>The poem is generally dated as late as the eleventh century, and the concluding stanza
betrays Christian influence almost unmistakably. It shows the confusion of traditions
manifest in all the later poems; for example, Brynhild is here not only a Valkyrie
but also a swan-maiden. Only three stanzas have any reference to the Guthrun-Gunnar
part of the story; otherwise the poem is concerned solely with the episode of Sigurth’s
finding the sleeping Valkyrie. Late as it is, therefore, it is essentially a Norse
creation, involving very few of the details of the German cycle (cf. introductory
note to <i>Gripisspo</i>).</p>

are not quoted in the <i>Nornageststhattr</i>. Presumably two lines, and perhaps more, have been lost. It has frequently been argued
that all or part of the passage from stanza 6 through stanza 10 (6–10, 7–10 or 8–10)
comes originally from the so-called <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, where it would undoubtedly fit exceedingly well. <i>Hild</i>: a Valkyrie name meaning “Fighter” (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 31). In such compound names as Brynhild (“Fighter in Armor”) the first element was
occasionally omitted. <i>Hlymdalir</i> (“Tumult-Dale”): a mythical name, merely signifying the place of battle as the home
of Valkyries.

of the Helgi tradition.

here, as in <i>Gripisspo</i>. In the version of the story wherein Sigurth met Brynhild before he encountered the
Gjukungs, Sigurth was bound by no oaths, and the union was completed; it is only in
the alternative version that the episode of the sword laid between the two occurs.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been already pointed out (introductory note to <i>Reginsmol</i>) that the compiler of the Eddic collection had clearly undertaken to formulate a
coherent narrative of the entire Sigurth cycle, piecing together the various poems
by means of prose narrative links. To some extent these links were based on traditions
existing outside of the lays themselves, but in the main the material was gathered
from the contents of the poems. The short prose passage entitled <i>Drap Niflunga</i>, which in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> immediately follows the <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, is just such a narrative link, and scarcely deserves a special heading, but as nearly
all editions separate it from the preceding and following poems, I have followed their
example.
</p>
<p>With Sigurth and Brynhild both dead, the story turns to the slaying of the sons of
Gjuki by Atli, Guthrun’s second husband, and to a few subsequent incidents, mostly
late incorporations from other narrative cycles, including the tragic death of Svanhild,
daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun and wife of Jormunrek (Ermanarich), and the exploits
of Hamther, son of Guthrun and her third husband, Jonak. These stories are told, or
outlined, in the two Atli lays, the second and third Guthrun lays, the <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, and the <i>Hamthesmol</i>. Had the compiler seen fit to put the Atli lays immediately after the <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, he would have needed only a very brief transitional note to make the course of the
story clear, but as the second Guthrun lay, the next poem in the collection, is a
lament following the death of Guthrun’s brothers, some sort of a narrative bridge
was manifestly needed.
</p>
<p><i>Drap Niflunga</i> is based entirely on the poems which follow it in the collection, with no use of
extraneous material. The part of the story which it summarizes belongs to the semi-historical
Burgundian tradition (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>), in many respects parallel to the familiar narrative of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, and, except in minor details, showing few essentially Northern additions. Sigurth
is scarcely mentioned, and the outstanding episode is the slaying of Gunnar and Hogni,
following their journey to Atli’s home.</p>

<p class="first" id="prose2.14">Gunnar and Hogni then took all the gold that Fafnir had had. There was strife between
the Gjukungs and Atli, for he held the Gjukungs guilty of Brynhild’s death. It was
agreed that they should give him Guthrun as wife, and they gave her a draught of forgetfulness
to drink before she would consent to be wedded to Atli. The sons of Atli were Erp
and Eitil, and Svanhild was the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun. King Atli invited
Gunnar and Hogni to come to him, and sent as messenger Vingi or Knefröth. Guthrun
was aware of treachery, and sent with him a message in runes that they should not
come, and as a token she sent to Hogni the ring Andvaranaut and tied a wolf’s hair
in it. Gunnar had sought Oddrun, Atli’s sister, for his wife, but had her not; then
he married Glaumvor, and Hogni’s wife was <span class="pageNum" id="pb449">[<a href="#pb449" class="pginternal">449</a>]</span>Kostbera; their sons were Solar and Snævar and Gjuki. And when the Gjukungs came to
Atli, then Guthrun besought her sons to plead for the lives of both the Gjukungs,
but they would not do it. Hogni’s heart was cut out, and Gunnar was cast into the
serpent’s den. He smote on the harp and put the serpents to sleep, but an adder stung
him in the liver.

cf. <i>Brot</i>, 17 and note. <i>Draught of forgetfulness</i>: according to the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Grimhild, Guthrun’s mother, administered this, just as she did the similar draught
which made Sigurth forget Brynhild. <i>Erp and Eitil</i>: Guthrun kills her two sons by Atli as part of her revenge; the annotator here explains
her act further by saying that Guthrun asked her sons to intercede with their father
in favor of Guthrun’s brothers, but that they refused, a detail which he appears to
have invented, as it is found nowhere else. <i>Svanhild</i>: cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 54 and note. <i>Vingi or Knefröth</i>: <i>Atlakvitha</i> (stanza 1) calls the messenger Knefröth; <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 4) speaks of two messengers, but names only one of them, Vingi. The annotator
has here tried, unsuccessfully, to combine the two accounts. <i>Andvaranaut</i>: regarding the origin of Andvari’s ring cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, prose after stanzas 4 and 5 and notes; Sigurth gave the ring to Guthrun. Here again
the annotator is combining two stories; in <i>Atlakvitha</i> (stanza 8) Guthrun sends a ring (not Andvaranaut) with a wolf’s hair; in <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 4) she sends a message written <span class="pageNum" id="pb449a">[<a href="#pb449a" class="pginternal">449</a>]</span>in runes. The messenger obscures these runes, and Kostbera, Hogni’s wife, who attempts
to decipher them, is not clear as to their meaning, though she suspects danger. <i>Oddrun</i>: cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 57 and note. <i>Glaumvor</i>: almost nothing is told of Gunnar’s second wife, though she appears frequently in
the <i>Atlamol</i>. <i>Kostbera</i> (or Bera), Hogni’s wife, is known only as skilled in runes. Her brother was Orkning.
The sons of Hogni and Kostbera, according to the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 28), were <i>Solar</i> and <i>Snævar</i>; the third son, <i>Gjuki</i>, named after his grandfather, seems to be an invention of the annotator’s. <i>Adder</i>: according to <i>Oddrunargratr</i> (stanza 30) Atli’s mother assumed this form in order to complete her son’s vengeance.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has already been pointed out (introductory note to <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>) that the tradition of Guthrun’s lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed,
and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume
verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined,
but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that
by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun’s
lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the
second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred
to by the annotator in the prose note following the <i>Brot</i> as “the old Guthrun lay,” and its character and state of preservation have combined
to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century,
whereas <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i> belongs a hundred years later.
</p>
<p>The poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious
omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers
of the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations
are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain
passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews
her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli’s
dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of
the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching
complete form; the <i>Reginsmol</i>, <i>Fafnismol</i>, and <i>Sigrdrifumol</i> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the “long” Sigurth lay remains,
and the others—<i>Gripisspo</i>, <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i> and <i>III</i>, <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, <i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, <i>Hamthesmol</i>, and the two Atli lays—are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth
centuries.
</p>
<p>An added reason for believing that <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North <span class="pageNum" id="pb451">[<a href="#pb451" class="pginternal">451</a>]</span>from Germany in verse form is the absence of most of the characteristic Norse additions
to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as “German
men say” (cf. <i>Brot</i>, concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother and brothers to become Atli’s
wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something
seems to have been lost), and Guthrun’s prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly
to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>).
</p>
<p>In the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i> the poem is entitled simply <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from
the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase “the old” is borrowed from the annotator’s
comment in the prose note at the end of the <i>Brot</i>.</p>

<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.15" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> <i>Thjothrek</i>: the famous Theoderich, king of the Ostrogoths, who became renowned in German story
as Dietrich von Bern. The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing
together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich, who was born about
455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about
376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich’s actual enemy, Odovakar,
and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i.e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to
have lost most of his men. The annotator found the material for this note in <i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb452a">[<a href="#pb452a" class="pginternal">452</a>]</span>was composed (early tenth century) it is probable that the story of Theoderich had
not reached the North at all, and the annotator is consequently wrong in giving the
poem its setting.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> Cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 17.

</p>
<p id="n2.15.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript. Some editions combine these two lines with either
stanza 5 or stanza 7.

<p id="n2.15.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Gotthorm</i>: from this it appears that in both versions of the death of Sigurth the mortally
wounded hero killed his murderer, the younger brother of Gunnar and Hogni. The story
of how Gotthorm was slain after killing Sigurth in his bed is told in <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 22–23, and in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> On lines 3–4 cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 1. Line 5 is probably spurious.

<p id="n2.15.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Many editions make one stanza of stanzas 12 and 13, reconstructing line 3; the manuscript
shows no gap. Bugge fills out the stanza thus: “The wolves were howling   |   on all
the ways, / The eagles cried   |   as their food they craved.”
</p>
<p id="n2.15.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> Cf. note on preceding stanza. Grundtvig suggests as a first line: “Long did I bide,
  |   my brothers awaiting.” Many editors reject line 4.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines
3–4 with lines 1–2 of stanza 15. <i>Hoalf</i> (or Half): Gering thinks this Danish king may be identical with Alf, son of King
Hjalprek, and second husband of Hjordis, Sigurth’s mother (cf. <i>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</i> and note), but the name was a common one. <i>Thora</i> and <i>Hokon</i> have not been identified (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, concluding prose, which is clearly based on this stanza). A Thora appears in <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 18, as the wife of Dag, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, the most famous of Denmark’s
mythical kings, and one of her sons is Alf (Hoalf?).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb455a">[<a href="#pb455a" class="pginternal">455</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.15.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. Some editors combine lines
5–6 with lines 1–2 of stanza 16, while others mark them as interpolated.
</p>

<p id="n2.15.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and most editions combine these two lines
either with lines 3–4 of stanza 16, with lines 1–2 of stanza 18, or with the whole
of stanza 18. Line 2 <span class="pageNum" id="pb456a">[<a href="#pb456a" class="pginternal">456</a>]</span>has been filled out in various ways. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase indicates that these two lines are the remains of a full stanza, the prose
passage running: “Now Guthrun was somewhat comforted of her sorrows. Then Grimhild
learned where Guthrun was now dwelling.” The first two lines may be the ones missing.
<i>Gothic</i>: the term “Goth” was used in the North without much discrimination to apply to all
south-Germanic peoples. In <i>Gripisspo</i>, 35, Gunnar, Grimhild’s son, appears as “lord of the Goths.”
</p>
<p id="n2.15.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. Grimhild is eager to have
amends made to Guthrun for the slaying of Sigurth and their son, Sigmund, because
Atli has threatened war if he cannot have Guthrun for his wife.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> Lines 5–6 are almost certainly interpolations, made by a scribe with a very vague
understanding of the meaning of the stanza, which refers simply to the journey of
the Gjukungs to bring their sister home from Denmark.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Lines 1–2 are probably interpolated, though the <i>Volsungasaga</i> includes the names. Some one apparently attempted to <span class="pageNum" id="pb457a">[<a href="#pb457a" class="pginternal">457</a>]</span>supply the names of Atli’s messengers, the “long-beard men” of line 4, who have come
to ask for Guthrun’s hand. Some commentators assume, as the <i>Volsungasaga</i> does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun,
but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19,
and that Guthrun received Atli’s emissaries in her brothers’ home. <i>Long-beards</i>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably
without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two
lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and
Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic. The manuscript indicates line 5 as
beginning a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> <i>Each</i>: the reference is presumably to Gunnar and Hogni, and perhaps also Grimhild. I suspect
that this stanza belongs before stanza 20.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> Stanzas 22–25 describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun,
just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild.
The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun’s statement in stanza 25 (cf. stanza
30), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas 22–25 after stanza 34.
<i>Blood of swine</i>: cf. <i>Hyndluljoth</i>, 39 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb458a">[<a href="#pb458a" class="pginternal">458</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.15.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> The <i>Volsungasaga</i> quotes stanzas 23–24. <i>Heather-fish</i>: a snake. <i>Haddings’ land</i>: the world of the dead, so called because, according to Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish
king Hadingus once visited it. It is possible that the comma should follow “heather-fish,”
making the “ear uncut” (of grain) come from the world of the dead.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> <i>Dew of the hearth</i>: soot.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> In the manuscript, and in some editions, the first line is in the third person plural:
“Then they forgot,   |   when the draught they had drunk.” The second line in the
original is manifestly in bad shape, and has been variously emended. <i>I forgot</i>: this emendation is doubtful, in view of stanza 30, but cf. note to stanza 22. <i>The kings all three</i>: probably Atli’s emissaries, though the interpolated lines of stanza 20 name four
of them. I suspect that line 4 is wrong, and should read: “Ere he himself (Atli)   |  
to speak began.” Certainly stanzas 26–27 <span class="pageNum" id="pb459a">[<a href="#pb459a" class="pginternal">459</a>]</span>fit Atli much better than they do Grimhild, and there is nothing unreasonable in Atli’s
having come in person, along with his tributary kings, to seek Guthrun’s hand. However,
the “three kings” may not be Atli’s followers at all, but Gunnar, Hogni, and the unnamed
third brother possibly referred to in <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 18.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> <i>Thy father’s</i>: So the manuscript, in which case the reference is obviously to Gjuki. But some editions
omit the “thy,” and if Atli, and not Grimhild, is speaking (cf. note on stanza 25),
the reference may be, as in line 3 of stanza 27, to the wealth of Atli’s father, Buthli.
<i>Hlothver</i>: the northern form of the Frankish name Chlodowech (Ludwig), but who this Hlothver
was, beyond the fact that he was evidently a Frankish king, is uncertain. If Atli
is speaking, he is presumably a Frankish ruler whose land Atli and his Huns have conquered.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Cf. note on stanza 25 as to the probable speaker.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> In stanzas 28–32 the dialogue, in alternate stanzas, is clearly between Guthrun and
her mother, Grimhild, though the manuscript does not indicate the speakers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb460a">[<a href="#pb460a" class="pginternal">460</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.15.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> <i>Sigmund</i>: son of Sigurth and Guthrun, killed at Brynhild’s behest.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> This stanza presents a strong argument for transposing the description of the draught
of forgetfulness (stanzas 22–24 and lines 1–2 of stanza 25) to follow stanza 33. <i>Raven</i>, etc.: the original is somewhat obscure, and the line may refer simply to the “corpse-eating
raven.”
</p>
<p id="n2.15.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza is immediately followed by the two lines which here,
following Bugge’s suggestion, appear <span class="pageNum" id="pb461a">[<a href="#pb461a" class="pginternal">461</a>]</span>as stanza 35. In lines 3–4 Guthrun foretells what will (and actually does) happen
if she is forced to become Atli’s wife. If stanza 35 really belongs here, it continues
the prophesy to the effect that Guthrun will have no rest till she has avenged her
brothers’ death.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Very likely the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as beginning
a new stanza. On the other hand, lines 3 and 5 may be interpolations. <i>Vinbjorg</i> and <i>Valbjorg</i>: apparently imaginary place-names.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>The kings</i>: presumably Gunnar and Hogni. <i>My sons</i>: regarding Guthrun’s slaying of her two sons by Atli, Erp and Eitil, cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 32. The loss of two lines, to the effect
that “Ill was that marriage for my brothers, and ill for Atli himself,” and the transposition
of the remaining two lines to this point, are indicated in a number of editions. <i>The warrior</i>, etc.: Atli, whom Guthrun kills.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb462a">[<a href="#pb462a" class="pginternal">462</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.15.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> The stanza describes the journey to Atli’s home, and sundry unsuccessful efforts
have been made to follow the travellers through Germany and down the Danube. <i>Foreign women</i>: slaves. Line 5, which the manuscript marks as beginning a stanza, is probably spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> After these two lines there appears to be a considerable gap, the lost stanzas giving
Guthrun’s story of the slaying of her brothers. It is possible that stanzas 38–45
came originally from another poem, dealing with Atli’s dream, and were here substituted
for the original conclusion of Guthrun’s lament. Many editions combine stanzas 37
and 38, or combine stanza 38 (the manuscript marks line 1 as beginning a stanza) with
lines 1–2 of stanza 39.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. The manuscript and
most editions do not indicate the speakers in this and the following stanzas.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb463a">[<a href="#pb463a" class="pginternal">463</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.15.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> Guthrun, somewhat obscurely, interprets Atli’s first dream (stanza 39) to mean that
she will cure him of an abscess by cauterizing it. Her interpretation is, of course,
intended merely to blind him to her purpose.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> In stanzas 41–43 Atli’s dreams forecast the death of his two sons, whose flesh Guthrun
gives him to eat (cf. <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 39, and <i>Atlamol</i>, 78).
</p>
<p id="n2.15.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> This stanza is evidently Guthrun’s intentionally cryptic <span class="pageNum" id="pb464a">[<a href="#pb464a" class="pginternal">464</a>]</span>interpretation of Atli’s dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful.
The word here rendered “sacrifice” may mean “sea-catch,” and the one rendered “beasts”
may mean “whales.” None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really
intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts
at night, and give their bodies to the people. Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying
of his two sons.
</p>
<p id="n2.15.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.15.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> With these two lines the poem abruptly ends; some editors assign the speech to Atli
(I think rightly), others to Guthrun. Ettmüller combines the lines with stanza 38.
Whether stanzas 38–45 originally belonged to Guthrun’s lament, or were interpolated
here in place of the lost conclusion of that poem from another one dealing with Atli’s
dreams (cf. note on stanza 37), it is clear that the end has been lost.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The short <i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i>, entitled in the manuscript simply <i>Guthrunarkvitha</i>, but so numbered in most editions to distinguish it from the first and second Guthrun
lays, appears only in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>. It is neither quoted nor paraphrased in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, the compilers of which appear not to have known the story with which it deals. The
poem as we have it is evidently complete and free from serious interpolations. It
can safely be dated from the first half of the eleventh century, for the ordeal by
boiling water, with which it is chiefly concerned, was first introduced into Norway
by St. Olaf, who died in 1030, and the poem speaks of it in stanza 7 as still of foreign
origin.
</p>
<p>The material for the poem evidently came from North Germany, but there is little indication
that the poet was working on the basis of a narrative legend already fully formed.
The story of the wife accused of faithlessness who proves her innocence by the test
of boiling water had long been current in Germany, as elsewhere, and had attached
itself to various women of legendary fame, but not except in this poem, so far as
we can judge, to Guthrun (Kriemhild). The introduction of Thjothrek (Theoderich, Dietrich,
Thithrek) is another indication of relative lateness, for the legends of Theoderich
do not appear to have reached the North materially before the year 1000. On the anachronism
of bringing Thjothrek to Atli’s court cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, introductory prose, note, in which the development of the Theoderich tradition in
its relation to that of Atli is briefly outlined.
</p>
<p><i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i> is, then, little more than a dramatic German story made into a narrative lay by a
Norse poet, with the names of Guthrun, Atli, Thjothrek, and Herkja incorporated for
the sake of greater effectiveness. Its story probably nowhere formed a part of the
living tradition of Sigurth and Atli, but the poem has so little distinctively Norse
coloring that it may possibly have been based on a story or even a poem which its
composer heard in Germany or from the lips of a German narrator.</p>

the introduction of Christianity, which took place around the year 1000. Some editions

<p class="first">The <i>Oddrunargratr</i> follows <i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>; it is not quoted or mentioned elsewhere, except that the composer of the “short”
Sigurth lay seems to have been familiar with it. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in
the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild’s prophecy from the “short” Sigurth lay.
That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year
1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli’s sister, and yet the <i>Oddrunargratr</i> is almost certainly older than the “short” Sigurth lay, so that the last half of
the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.

<p>Where or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain. She
does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed
that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to “old tales” concerning
her. She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet
has used effectively the episode of Gunnar’s death, with the implication that Atli’s
vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar’s
love affair with Oddrun. The material which forms the background of Oddrun’s story
belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern
additions. The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate
that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance
by the time this poem was composed.
</p>
<p>In the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the
heading “Of Borgny and Oddrun,” but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts,
have given the poem the title it bears here. Outside of a few apparently defective
stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the poem has clearly been preserved in
good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked.</p>

<p class="first" id="prose2.17">Heithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny. Vilmund was the
name of the man who was her lover. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun,
Atli’s sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki. About
this story is the following poem.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.17" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> Nothing further is known of <i>Heithrek</i>, <i>Borgny</i> or <i>Vilmund</i>. The annotator has added the name of Borgny’s father, but otherwise his material
comes from the poem itself. <i>Oddrun</i>, sister of Atli and Brynhild, here appears as proficient in birth-runes (cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 8). Regarding her love for <i>Gunnar</i>, Guthrun’s brother, and husband of her sister, Brynhild, cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 57 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> <i>Olden tales</i>: this may be merely a stock phrase, or it may really mean that the poet found his
story in oral prose tradition. <i>Morningland</i>: the poem’s geography is utterly obscure. “Morningland” is apparently identical with
“Hunland” (stanza 4), and yet Oddrun is herself sister of the king of the Huns. Vigfusson
tries to make “Mornaland” into “Morva land” and explain it as Moravia. Probably it
means little more than a country lying vaguely in the East. With stanza 28 the confusion
grows worse.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb471a">[<a href="#pb471a" class="pginternal">471</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.17.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> Line 3 (cf. <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, 17) or line 5 (cf. <i>Thrymskvitha</i>, 2), both quoted from older poems, is probably spurious; the manuscript marks line
3 as the beginning of a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> Line 1 in the original appears to have lost its second half. In line 2 the word rendered
“has happened” is doubtful. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of lines
3–4, and a few editors assign them to Borgny herself.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. <i>For the woman</i>: conjectural; the manuscript has instead: “What warrior now   |   hath worked this
woe?” The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Line 5, apparently
modeled on line 4 of stanza 13, is probably spurious.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb472a">[<a href="#pb472a" class="pginternal">472</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.17.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> <i>Charms</i>: cf. <i>Sigrdrifumol</i>, 8.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> <i>Hogni’s slayer</i>: obviously Vilmund, but unless he was the one of Atli’s followers who actually cut
out Hogni’s heart (cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>), there is nothing else to connect him with Hogni’s death. Sijmons emends the line
to read “Born of the sister   |   of Hogni’s slayer.”
</p>
<p id="n2.17.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> Regarding <i>Frigg</i> as a goddess of healing cf. <i>Svipdagsmol</i>, 52, note. Regarding <i>Freyja</i> as the friend of lovers cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 14, note. A line is very possibly missing from this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. In line 2 the word rendered “earn” is omitted
in the manuscript, but nearly all editions have supplied it. Line 5 is clearly either
interpolated or out of place. It may be all that is left of a stanza which stood between
stanzas 15 and 16, or it may belong in stanza 12.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb473a">[<a href="#pb473a" class="pginternal">473</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.10" class="pginternal">10–20</a>.</span> In the manuscript the order is as follows: 12; 13; 14; 15, 3–4; 10; 11; 16; 17; 18;
19, 1–2; 15, 1–2; 19, 3–4; 20. The changes made here, following several of the editions,
are: (a) the transposition of stanzas 10–11, which are clearly dialogue, out of the
body of the lament to a position just before it; (b) the transposition of lines 1–2
of stanza 15 to their present position from the middle of stanza 19.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10–20.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10–20. The word rendered
“evil” in line 1 is a conjectural addition. Apparently Borgny was present at Atli’s
court while the love affair between Oddrun and Gunnar was in progress, and criticised
Oddrun for her part in it. <i>A draught</i>, etc.: apparently in reference to a secret meeting of the lovers.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 9; cf. note on stanzas 10–20. No gap
is indicated, but something has presumably been lost. Grundtvig supplies as a first
line: “The maid her evil   |   days remembered,” and inserts as a second line line

some editions combine lines 3–4 with lines 3–4 of stanza 15. Making Buthli plan the
marriage of Oddrun and Gunnar may be a sheer invention of the poet, or may point to
an otherwise lost version of the legend.

<p id="n2.17.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Lines 1–2 have here been transposed from the middle of stanza 19; cf. note on stanzas
10–20. <i>Wish-maid</i>: a Valkyrie, so called because the Valkyries fullfilled Othin’s wish in choosing
the slain heroes for Valhall. The reference to Brynhild as a Valkyrie by no means
fits with the version of the story used in stanzas 16–17, and the poet seems to have
attempted to combine the two contradictory traditions; cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, note on stanza 44. In the manuscript stanzas 10–11 follow line 4 of stanza 15.

<p id="n2.17.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> In stanzas 16–17 the underlying story seems to be the one used in <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i> (particularly stanzas 32–39), and referred to in <i>Guthrunarkvitha I</i>, 24, wherein Gunnar and Sigurth lay siege to Atli’s city (it here appears as Brynhild’s)
and are bought off only by Atli’s giving Brynhild to Gunnar as wife, winning her consent
thereto by falsely representing to her that Gunnar is Sigurth. This version is, of
course, utterly at variance with the one in which Sigurth wins Brynhild for Gunnar
by riding through the ring of flames, and is probably more closely akin to the early
German traditions. In the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> Brynhild appears as a queen ruling over lands and peoples. <i>Fafnir’s slayer</i>: Sigurth.

probably, as in stanza 20, Gunnar’s proffered “marriage gold” for the hand of Oddrun.

<p id="n2.17.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Murky wood</i>: the forest which divided Atli’s realm from that of the Gjukungs is in <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 3, called Myrkwood. This hardly accords with the extraordinary geography of stanzas
28–29, or with the journey described in <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 36.

</p>
<p id="n2.17.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> If a stanza has been lost after stanza 25, it may well have told of Atli’s treacherous
invitation to the Gjukungs to visit him; cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>, which likewise tells of the slaying of <i>Hogni</i> and Gunnar (<i>the other</i>).
</p>
<p id="n2.17.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> In the manuscript these three lines follow line 2 of stanza 28. No gap is indicated
in the manuscript. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Guthrun gives her brother the harp, with which he puts the serpents to sleep. The
episode is undoubtedly related to the famous thirtieth Aventiure of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, in which Volker plays the followers of Gunther to sleep before the final battle.

<p id="n2.17.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> In the manuscript the three lines of stanza 27 follow line 2, and line 3 is marked
as beginning a new stanza. <i>Geirmund</i>: nothing further is known of him, but he seems to be an ally or retainer of Atli,
or possibly his brother. <i>Hlesey</i>: the poet’s geography is here in very bad shape. Hlesey is (or may be) the Danish
island of Läsö, in the Kattegat (cf. <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>, 37 and note), and thither he has suddenly transported not only Gunnar’s death-place
but Atli’s whole dwelling (cf. stanza 29), despite his previous references to the
ride to Hunland (stanzas 3–4) and the “murky wood” (stanza 23). Geirmund’s home, where
Oddrun has gone, is separated from Hlesey and Atli’s dwelling by a sound (stanza 29).
However, geographical accuracy is seldom to be looked for in heroic epic poetry.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> Many editions combine this stanza with lines 3–4 of stanza 28. <i>The sound</i>: cf. note on stanza 28.
</p>
<p id="n2.17.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.17.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. <i>Atli’s mother</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> does not follow this version; Gunnar puts all the serpents but one to sleep with
his harp playing, “but a mighty and evil adder crawled to him and drove his fangs
into him till they reached his heart, and so he died.” It is possible that “Atli”
is a scribal error for a word meaning “of serpents.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are two Atli poems in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, the <i>Atlakvitha</i> (<i>Lay of Atli</i>) and the <i>Atlamol</i> (<i>Ballad of Atli</i>). The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were
extensively used by the compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i>. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word “Greenland,”
which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible,
and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there
was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.
</p>
<p>The two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons
of Gjuki to Atli’s court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister,
Guthrun, Atli’s wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the <i>Atlakvitha</i>, tells the story with little elaboration; the <i>Atlamol</i>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently
of the poet’s invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite
lacking in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical
form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the <i>Harbarthsljoth</i>), employed consistently and smoothly in the <i>Atlamol</i>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction)
in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>.
</p>
<p>It is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter
<i>Atlakvitha</i> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer <i>Atlamol</i> some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian;
in the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and “go into another light,” and
in the <i>Atlakvitha</i> there is frequent use of mythological names (e.g., Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an
evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit
the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew
rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982–985, and
its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly
in the case of the <i>Atlamol</i>, points <span class="pageNum" id="pb481">[<a href="#pb481" class="pginternal">481</a>]</span>likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the “Western Isles”; and the
two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and
others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or elsewhere,
it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and
that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account
of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard’s <i>Voyages of the Norsemen to America</i>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily
vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett’s
<i>Thorgils</i>, taken from the <i>Floamannasaga</i>.
</p>
<p>From the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse
in either the <i>Atlakvitha</i> or the <i>Atlamol</i>. The story is the one outlined in the prose <i>Drap Niflunga</i> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern
blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to <i>Gripisspo</i>). In the <i>Atlakvitha</i>, indeed, the word “Burgundians” is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either
poem; Sigurth’s name appears but once, in the <i>Atlamol</i>. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little
of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts
of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the
<i>Atlamol</i>, is essentially Norse.
</p>
<p>As has been said, the <i>Atlakvitha</i> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed
with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type.
How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has
been suggested that the composer of the <i>Atlakvitha</i> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in Fornyrthislag, and this suggestion has
much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost
certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits
would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the <i>Atlakvitha</i>. As for the <i>Atlamol</i>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the
<i>Atlakvitha</i> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there
are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names.
</p>
<p>The translation of the <i>Atlakvitha</i> is rendered peculiarly difficult <span class="pageNum" id="pb482">[<a href="#pb482" class="pginternal">482</a>]</span>by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and
above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse,
involving much guesswork as to their meanings. The notes do not attempt to indicate
all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction
of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which
are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without
cataloguing the proposed solutions.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.18" class="pginternal">Prose</a>.</i> On the marriage of <i>Guthrun</i> to <i>Atli</i> at the instigation of her brothers, Gunnar and Hogni, and on the slaying of Atli
and his two sons, Erp and Eitil, cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i> and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> Line 1 apparently is in Fornyrthislag. <i>Knefröth</i> (the name is spelt in various ways, and its meaning is uncertain): in the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 4) there are two messengers, one named Vingi and the other unnamed; the annotator
combines the two versions in the <i>Drap Niflunga</i>. <i>Benches</i>, etc.: the adjective rendered “round the hearth,” which etymologically it ought to
mean, is made obscure by its application to “helmets” in stanzas 3 and 17.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb483a">[<a href="#pb483a" class="pginternal">483</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Falseness</i>: i.e., Gunnar’s followers concealed their fear and hatred of the Huns at the feast;
but the word may mean “fear of treachery.” <i>War-hall</i>: the word used is “Valhall,” the name of Othin’s hall of slain warriors.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Myrkwood the secret</i> (the adjective is literally “unknown”): the forest which divided Atli’s realm from
that of the Gjukungs; cf. <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 23 and note. <i>Around the hearth</i>: the adjective is the same one which is applied to “benches” in stanza 1 (cf. note);
it may be an error here, or it may possibly have the force of “of your followers,”
i.e., Gunnar is to arm the men of his household (those who are round his hearth) for
the journey.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Slaves</i>, etc.: some editions have “swords in plenty.” <i>Scarlet</i>: the word apparently means “slaughter-red,” “blood-red,” but it may mean something
entirely different.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb484a">[<a href="#pb484a" class="pginternal">484</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Gnitaheith</i>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 11). Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir’s death, and the Gjukungs after they
had killed Sigurth. Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death
of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or—as seems more
likely—the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. <i>Stems</i>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,—an evident northern touch,
if the word is correct, which is by no means certain. <i>Danp</i>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. <i>Rigsthula</i>, 49 and note), but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word “Danparstaþir”
(the phrase here used is “<span lang="non">staþi Danpar</span>”), used in the <i>Hervararsaga</i> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring
to the region of the Dnieper. The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long
after it had lost all definite significance. <i>Myrkwood</i>: cf. note on stanza 3.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb485a">[<a href="#pb485a" class="pginternal">485</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> The stanza is clearly in bad shape; the manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning
a new stanza. In line 5 the manuscript has “and shield” after “helm.” <i>Kjar</i>: Gering ingeniously identifies this Kjar with Kjar the father of Olrun, mentioned
in the <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, introductory prose and stanza 2, on the basis of a genealogy in the <i>Flateyjarbok</i>, in which Authi, the grandfather of Kjar (by no means certainly the same man) and
Buthli, father of Atli, are mentioned as making a raiding voyage together. This identification,
however, rests on slight evidence.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. One editor gives the first sentence to
Gunnar. <i>She</i>, etc.: Guthrun, seeking to warn her brothers of Atli’s treachery, sends them a ring
with a wolf’s hair as a sign of danger; in the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 4) she sends a message written in runes; cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>. <i>Heath-dweller</i>: wolf.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb486a">[<a href="#pb486a" class="pginternal">486</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> In line 1 the manuscript has “His comrades did not urge Gunnar,” but the name, involving
a metrical error, seems to have been inserted through a scribal blunder.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no lacuna, but probably two lines have dropped out, for
the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase runs: “Give us to drink in great cups, for it may well be that this shall
be our last feast.” <i>Fjornir</i>: Gunnar’s cup-bearer.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar’s terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns
it to Hogni. Apparently, however, Gunnar means that if he and his men are not valiant
enough to make the journey and return safely, it matters little what may happen to
them. <i>Niflungs</i>: regarding the application of this name to Gunnar’s Burgundians cf. <i>Brot</i>, 17 and note. <i>Bears</i>: these “black” bears have been used as arguments against the Greenland origin of
the poem. <i>And make glad the dogs</i>: i.e., by giving them corpses to eat, but the phrase in the original is more than
doubtful.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb487a">[<a href="#pb487a" class="pginternal">487</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Some editions in line 2 read “home of the Niflungs” instead of “their home,” and
others “home of the Huns,” the manuscript reading being “home of the men.” <i>Heir</i>: the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanza 28) names two sons of Hogni, Snævar and Solar, both of whom make the journey
with their father and are killed. The <i>Volsungasaga</i>, combining the two versions, says that Snævar and Solar went with their father, and
implies that it was a third and still younger son who said: “Farewell, and have a
good time” (thus literally).
</p>
<p id="n2.18.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Myrkwood</i>: cf. stanza 3 and note; the journey is here made by land, whereas in the <i>Atlamol</i> it is made partly by boat; cf. <i>Atlamol</i>, 34 and note. <i>Whip-fearers</i>: horses, but there is some uncertainty as to the word.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> In line 1 the manuscript has “land” instead of “halls,” which involves a metrical
error. <i>Watch-towers</i>: the word used is identical with the name of Othin’s watch-tower, Hlithskjolf (cf.
<i>Grimnismol</i>, introductory prose). <i>Buthli</i>: the manuscript has “Bikki,” which has led some editors to transfer this stanza to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb488a">[<a href="#pb488a" class="pginternal">488</a>]</span>the <i>Hamthesmol</i>, placing it between stanzas 16 and 17; it seems more likely, however, that “Bikki”
was a scribal error for “Buthli.” Regarding Bikki cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 63 and note. Line 4 is apparently in Fornyrthislag.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Line 1 in the manuscript is apparently incorrectly copied, and some editions omit
“Mid weapons and lances” and assume a gap in either line 1 or line 3.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> This may be the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 5 as beginning
a new stanza. Editorial conjectures are <span class="pageNum" id="pb489a">[<a href="#pb489a" class="pginternal">489</a>]</span>numerous and varied. <i>Household</i>: the phrase is the same “helms round the hearth” commented on in stanza 3. Some editions
insert a conjectural line after line 3. <i>Sword-norns</i>, etc.: the line is exceedingly obscure, and the phrase rendered “sword-norns” may
mean “corpse-norns.” Apparently it refers to the warrior-women of the Huns, the “shield-maids”
of line 5 and of stanza 45. Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early
Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached

<p id="n2.18.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no lacuna and does not name the speaker; perhaps a line
similar to line 1 of stanza 24 (or 26) should be inserted here. <i>Rhine</i>: Gunnar’s Burgundian home is here clearly localized. After this stanza it is probable
that a passage describing the battle has been lost.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> These two lines, apparently the remains of a full stanza, <span class="pageNum" id="pb490a">[<a href="#pb490a" class="pginternal">490</a>]</span>may belong after stanza 20. <i>Burgundians’ king</i>: the phrase may mean “Burgundians’ men,” i.e., they bound all the Burgundians who
were left alive after the battle. This is the only place in the poems in which the
name “Burgundian” appears; that the poet had no very clear conception of its meaning
is indicated by the fact that in stanza 21 he calls Gunnar “king of the Goths.”
</p>
<p id="n2.18.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza, though most editions have attempted to expand
the lines into Malahattr. The exploits of Hogni (Hagene), with the names of many of
his victims, are told in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. <i>The fire</i>: in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> Kriemhild has the hall set on fire, and the Burgundians fight amid the flames. Line
4 is clearly defective, and some editors regard the name “Gunnar” as all that is left
of the first two lines of stanza 21.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> Again apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Editors have attempted various
combinations of the lines. <i>Gold</i>: presumably Sigurth’s treasure.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; perhaps a first line similar to line
1 of stanza 24 should appear here. Some editors, however, assume that a line is missing
after line 3. <span class="pageNum" id="pb491a">[<a href="#pb491a" class="pginternal">491</a>]</span>Gunnar demands proof that Hogni is dead because, as stanza 28 shows, he is unwilling
to die himself until he is assured that the secret of the treasure will perish with
him. He did not, of course, intend that the heart should be cut from the living Hogni.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Most editions assume a gap (lines 1–2, 2–3 or 3–4). <i>Hjalli</i>: Atli’s cook, killed to deceive Gunnar, as Atli hoped to wring the secret of the
hoard from Hogni if Gunnar remained silent. In the <i>Atlamol</i> (stanzas 59–60) Atli’s men prepare to kill Hjalli, but he is spared at Hogni’s intercession.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> <i>Helm-hammerer</i> (literally “helmet-smith”): warrior, i.e., Hogni. No gap indicated in the manuscript.

<p id="n2.18.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> Line 1 may belong elsewhere (stanzas 18 or 22).
</p>
<p id="n2.18.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> Apparently the remains of two Fornyrthislag lines; the manuscript combines them with
lines 1–2 of stanza 28. Gunnar foretells Atli’s speedy death.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Apparently in Fornyrthislag. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of
a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3–4 with stanza 29. This stanza explains
Gunnar’s demand for Hogni’s heart in stanza 22.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as the beginning of a stanza. <i>Rhine</i>, etc.: the stanza shows the blending of <span class="pageNum" id="pb493a">[<a href="#pb493a" class="pginternal">493</a>]</span>three different traditions with regard to the treasure: the German tradition of the
gold of the Rhine (cf. <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, 16, and <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 16), the tradition, likewise German, of the hoard of the Nibelungen (Niflungs),
early blended with the first one, and finally the northern tradition of the theft
of Andvari’s treasure by Othin, Hönir, and Loki (cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, 1–9).
</p>
<p id="n2.18.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Apparently all that is left of a full stanza. The manuscript does not name Atli as
the speaker, and Grundtvig inserts: “Then Atli called,   |   the king of the Huns,”
as a first line. Some editors combine this line with the two lines of stanza 33. <i>Wagon</i>: in <i>Brot</i>, 16, Gunnar is led to his death in the serpents’ den on horseback, not in a wagon.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> The stanza in the original is hopelessly confused. <i>Glaum</i>: this horse of Atli’s is mentioned by name elsewhere. <i>Long-maned</i>: uncertain. The manuscript indicates no gap, but something has evidently been lost.
<i>Gods of slaughter</i>: perhaps the phrase, usually applied to Othin and the other gods, is here used simply
to mean “heroes,” i.e., Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. Line 4 suggests Guthrun’s tearlessness
after Sigurth’s death (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 11).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb494a">[<a href="#pb494a" class="pginternal">494</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. <i>Sigtyr</i> (“Victory-God”): Othin; what particular mountain (if any) is meant is unknown. <i>Horse of the rest-bed</i>: probably this means “bedpost,” i.e., the support of the marriage-bed. <i>Ull</i>: the archer-god, cf. <i>Grimnismol</i>, 5 and note. Nothing is known of his ring.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Some editors combine the two lines
with the line here indicated as stanza 30. <i>Champer of bits</i>: horse. The manuscript indicates no gap.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> Six Fornyrthislag lines which editors have tried to reconstruct in all sorts of ways.
The manuscript marks line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza. Regarding the serpents’
den, Gunnar’s harp-playing, and the manner of his death, cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i> and <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 27–30, and notes. In <i>Atlamol</i>, 62, Gunnar plays the harp with his feet, his hands being bound, and some editors
change <i>hand</i> in line 4 to “foot.” Lines 5–6 may be interpolated, or, as Bugge maintains, lines
1–4 may have been expanded out of two lines.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb495a">[<a href="#pb495a" class="pginternal">495</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Two (possibly three) of the
lines appear to be in Fornyrthislag. <i>Field</i>: so the manuscript, involving a metrical error; many editions have “wood.”
</p>
<p id="n2.18.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> <i>Young beasts</i>: Guthrun means Atli’s sons, Erp and Eitil, but of course he thinks she refers to
newly slaughtered beasts; cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 41–45.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> <i>Youths</i>: a conjectural addition. <i>The brave ones</i> is also conjectural, the manuscript having “each.” No gap indicated in the manuscript;
some editions insert as line 3 or line 4 a slightly altered version of line 2 of stanza
45.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb496a">[<a href="#pb496a" class="pginternal">496</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.18.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> No gap indicated in the manuscript, but the two fragments cannot be fitted together
as one line. <i>The shining one</i>: Guthrun.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> <i>Giver of swords</i>: generous prince, i.e., Atli. <i>Honey</i>: cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 42. <i>To send to thy followers</i>: literally, “to send from thy high seat.”
</p>
<p id="n2.18.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza. <i>Merry with ale</i>: presumably this refers to Atli, but the manuscript reading makes it apply to the
two boys. <i>Sharers of gold</i>: princes. Line 5 is either interpolated or all that is left of a separate stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> The text of the whole stanza has required a considerable amount of emendation. Lines
3–5 may have been expanded out of two lines, or line 5 may be an interpolation, possibly
from stanza <span class="pageNum" id="pb497a">[<a href="#pb497a" class="pginternal">497</a>]</span>12 of the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>. <i>Weapons</i>: the word literally means “good-weaving,” and may refer to silken garments, but this
hardly fits the noun here rendered “clashing.” <i>Wept not</i>: cf. stanza 31 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Line 1 appears to be in Fornyrthislag. Guthrun distributes Atli’s treasures among
his followers apparently to prevent their wrath at the slaying of Erp and Eitil from
turning against her; Atli, as stanza 43 shows, is too drunk to realize or prevent
what she is doing.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The second half of line 4 is apparently an error, but none of the editorial suggestions
have improved it.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> Guthrun allows the dogs and the house-thralls, who had no part in Gunnar’s death,
to escape before she burns the dwelling <span class="pageNum" id="pb498a">[<a href="#pb498a" class="pginternal">498</a>]</span>with all who are left therein. In <i>Atlamol</i>, stanzas 83–84, Atli is slain by a son of Hogni (Hniflung?) with Guthrun’s help.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.45"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.45" class="pginternal">45</a>.</span> Some editions transfer line 2 to stanza 37; others reject line 3 as interpolated.
<i>Myrkheim</i> (“Dark-Home”): probably identical with Myrkwood; cf. stanza 3. <i>Temple</i>: probably both here and in stanza 42 the word means little more than the place where
Atli’s treasures were kept; the poet was by no means literal in his use of terms connected
with the heathen religion. <i>Buthlungs</i>: sons of Buthli, i.e., Atli and his family. <i>Shield-maids</i>: cf. stanza 17 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.18.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.18.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> The entire stanza is very likely a later addition. <i>Three kings</i>: Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil.

<h3 class="main"> <span class="sc">Introductory Note</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many of the chief facts regarding the <i>Atlamol</i>, which follows the <i>Atlakvitha</i> in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription
in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland,
is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the
general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics,
again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation
there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and
the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two
lines may be suspected, the <i>Atlamol</i> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.
</p>
<p>Throughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically
sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the
understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as
that of the <i>Atlakvitha</i>; it tells of Atli’s message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli’s home, the
slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun’s bitterness over the death of her brothers,
and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare outline the <i>Atlamol</i> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians
and the death of Attila (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters,
apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both
the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys
by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the
Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the <i>Atlamol’s</i> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give
it a kind of emotional vividness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of
the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in
which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted
to the understanding and tastes of its <span class="pageNum" id="pb500">[<a href="#pb500" class="pginternal">500</a>]</span>eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.
</p>
<p>In what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet
cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on
the subject, and possibly with the <i>Atlakvitha</i> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the <i>Atlamol</i>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems
doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears,
though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible
to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions
and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.
</p>
<p>The poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular
than in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>. The compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main
it is paraphrased with great fidelity.</p>

(here <i>Vingi</i>), cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i> and note. <i>Limafjord</i>: probably the Limfjord of northern Jutland, an important point in the wars of the
eleventh century. The name was derived from “Eylimafjǫrþ,” i.e., Eylimi’s fjord. The
poet may really have thought that the kingdom of the Burgundians was in Jutland, or
he may simply have taken a well-known name for the sake of vividness.

<p id="n2.19.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Some editions place this stanza between stanzas 7 and 8. <i>Kostbera</i> (“The Giver of Food”) and <i>Glaumvor</i> (“The Merry”): presumably creations of the poet. <i>Both</i>: Atli’s two emissaries, Vingi and the one here unnamed (Knefröth?).
</p>
<p id="n2.19.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> It is altogether probable that a stanza has been lost between stanzas 6 and 7, in
which Gunnar is first invited, and replies doubtfully. <i>Made promise</i>: many editions emend the text to read “promised the journey.” The text of line 4
is obscure; the manuscript reads “nitti” (“refused”), which many editors have changed
to “hlitti,” which means exactly the opposite.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> No gap is indicated in the manuscript; Bugge adds (line <span class="pageNum" id="pb503a">[<a href="#pb503a" class="pginternal">503</a>]</span>3): “Then the warriors rose,   |   and to slumber made ready.” The manuscript indicates
line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of
lines 1–2. Others suggest the loss of a line after line 4.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.9"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.9" class="pginternal">9</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as the beginning of a stanza; cf. note on
stanza 8.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Some editions combine this stanza with lines 1–2 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates

</p>
<p id="n2.19.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 1–2, or combine them with stanza

<p id="n2.19.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Line 5 may be spurious, or else all that is left of a lost stanza. The manuscript
marks it as the beginning of a new stanza, which, as the text stands, is clearly impossible.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> The manuscript, followed by some editions, has “Hogni spake” in the middle of line
1. <i>Ill</i>: the manuscript and many editions have “this.” <i>The king</i>: Atli.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue between Kostbera and
Hogni (stanzas 14–19). Two lines may possibly have been lost after line 2, filling
out stanza 14 and <span class="pageNum" id="pb505a">[<a href="#pb505a" class="pginternal">505</a>]</span>making stanza 15 (then consisting of lines 3–4 of stanza 14 and lines 1–2 of stanza
15) the account of Kostbera’s first dream. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning
a new stanza. In any case, the lost lines cannot materially have altered the meaning.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> <i>Saw I</i>: the manuscript here, as also in stanzas 16, 18, 21, 22, and 24, has “methought,”
which involves a metrical error. Some editors regard lines 3–4 as the remains of a
four-line stanza. Regarding Kostbera’s warning dreams, and Hogni’s matter-of-fact
interpretations of them, cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 39–44.
</p>

<p id="n2.19.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> Two lines may have been lost after line 2, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase gives no clue. <i>Ice-bear</i>: polar bears, common in Greenland, are very rarely found in Iceland, and never in
Norway, a fact which substantiates the manuscript’s reference to Greenland as the
home of the poem.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of a line after
line 1 or 2; Grundtvig adds, after line 1: “Black were his feathers,   |   with blood
was he covered.” <i>Atli’s spirit</i>: the poet’s folk-lore seems here a bit weak. Presumably he means such a female following-spirit
(“fylgja”) as appears in <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, prose following stanza 34 (cf. note thereon), but the word he uses, “hamr” (masculine)
means “skin,” “shape.” He may, however, imply that Atli had assumed the shape of an
eagle for this occasion.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.

<p id="n2.19.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, but none of the many attempted emendations have
made sense out of the words as they stand. The proper location for the missing words
is sheer guesswork. <i>Two roads</i>: probably the meaning is that their way (i.e., their success) would be doubtful.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue (stanzas 21–26). No
gap is indicated after line 2. Most editors assume the loss of two lines or of a full
stanza after <span class="pageNum" id="pb508a">[<a href="#pb508a" class="pginternal">508</a>]</span>stanza 21 giving Gunnar’s interpretation of Glaumvor’s dream, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> gives no clue, as it does not mention this first dream at all. Grundtvig suggests
as Gunnar’s answer: “Banners are gleaming,   |   since of gallows didst dream, / And
wealth it must mean   |   that thou serpents didst watch.” <i>Gods’ doom</i>: an odd, and apparently mistaken, use of the phrase “ragna rök” (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, introductory note).
</p>
<p id="n2.19.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2. Possibly the concluding phrase of
line 2 should be “bloody spears,” as in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> Again Gunnar’s interpretation is missing, and most editors either assume a gap or
construct two Malahattr lines out of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> prose paraphrase, which runs: “The grain shall <span class="pageNum" id="pb509a">[<a href="#pb509a" class="pginternal">509</a>]</span>flow, since thou hast dreamed of rivers, and when we go to the fields, often the chaff
rises above our feet.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> The meaning of line 4 is uncertain, but apparently it refers to the guardian spirits
or lesser Norns (cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, 12–13 and notes).
</p>
<p id="n2.19.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> <i>Five</i>: Gunnar, Hogni, and the three mentioned in stanza 28.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Perhaps a line has been lost before line 1; Grundtvig supplies: “Gunnar and Hogni,
  |   the heirs twain of Gjuki.” <i>Snævar</i> (the manuscript here has “Snevar”), <i>Solar</i> and <i>Orkning</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb510a">[<a href="#pb510a" class="pginternal">510</a>]</span>appear only in this poem and in the prose narratives based on it. Lines 2–3 may have
been expanded out of one line, or possibly line 3 is spurious. The manuscript indicates
line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza out of
lines 4–5, many of them assuming the loss of two lines. <i>Shield-tree</i>: warrior (Orkning), here identified as Kostbera’s brother. <i>Fair-decked ones</i>: women, i.e., Glaumvor and Kostbera. <i>Fjord</i>: perhaps specifically the <i>Limafjord</i> mentioned in stanza 4.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig inserts (line 2): “The evil was clear
  |   when his words he uttered.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> <i>Bera</i>: Kostbera; the first element in compound feminine <span class="pageNum" id="pb511a">[<a href="#pb511a" class="pginternal">511</a>]</span>proper names was not infrequently omitted; cf. Hild for Brynhild (<i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, 6). The manuscript indicates no gap; Grundtvig inserts (line 2): “And clear was
her cry   |   to her kinsmen dear.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.32"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.32" class="pginternal">32</a>.</span> Hogni’s method of cheering his wife and sister-in-law is somewhat unusual, for the
meaning of lines 3–4 is that good wishes and blessings are of little use in warding
off danger.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.33"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</span> Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2; Grundtvig supplies: “Then weeping
did Glaumvor   |   go to her rest-bed, / And sadly did Bera   |   her spinning wheel
seek.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.34"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.34" class="pginternal">34</a>.</span> <i>Keel</i>, etc.: in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, and presumably in the older German tradition, Hagene breaks his oar steering the
Burgundians across the Danube (stanza 1564), and, after all have landed, splinters
the boat (stanza 1581) in order that there may be no retreating. The poet here seems
to have confused the story, <span class="pageNum" id="pb512a">[<a href="#pb512a" class="pginternal">512</a>]</span>connecting the breaking of the ship’s keel with the violence of the rowing, but echoing
the older legend in the last line, wherein the ship is allowed to drift away after
the travellers have landed. <i>Oar-loops</i>: the thongs by which the oars in a Norse boat were made fast to the <i>thole-pins</i>, the combination taking the place of the modern oarlock.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.35"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions combine
it with stanza 36, some of them assuming the loss of a line from stanza 35. In the
<i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase the second half of line 4 is made a part of Vingi’s speech: “Better had
ye left this undone.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.36"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.36" class="pginternal">36</a>.</span> Cf. note on preceding stanza; the manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning
a stanza. Line 3 may be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.37"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.37" class="pginternal">37</a>.</span> In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase the second half of line 1 and the first half of line 2 are included in
Hogni’s speech.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb513a">[<a href="#pb513a" class="pginternal">513</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.38"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.38" class="pginternal">38</a>.</span> Possibly two lines have been lost after line 2.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.39"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.39" class="pginternal">39</a>.</span> It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas 39 and 40,
for the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point. The manuscript indicates no gap, and
most editions combine stanzas 39 and 40 as a single stanza. The prose passage, indicating
the substance of what, if anything, is lost, runs as follows: “ ‘Be welcome among
us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had,
and that now belongs to Guthrun.’ Gunnar said: ‘Never shalt thou get that gold, and
men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou
dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb514a">[<a href="#pb514a" class="pginternal">514</a>]</span>and with little grudging toward eagle and wolf.’ ” The demand for the treasure likewise
appears in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.40"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</span> These two lines, which most editions combine with stanza 39, may be the first or
last two of a four-line stanza. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> gives Atli’s speech very much as it appears here.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.41"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.41" class="pginternal">41</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; Grundtvig adds as a first line: “Then
Hogni laughed loud   |   where the slain Vingi lay.” Many editors assume the loss
of a line somewhere in the stanza. <i>Unarmed</i>: Hogni does not see Atli’s armed followers, who are on the other side of the courtyard
(stanza 39). <i>One</i>: Vingi.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.42"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.42" class="pginternal">42</a>.</span> Most editors assume the loss of one line, after either line 1 or line 3.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.43"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.43" class="pginternal">43</a>.</span> The manuscript reading of lines 1–2, involving a metrical error, is: “In the house
came the word   |   of the warring without, / Loud in front of the hall   |   they
heard a thrall shouting.” Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line <span class="pageNum" id="pb515a">[<a href="#pb515a" class="pginternal">515</a>]</span>2, the missing passage giving the words of the thrall. The manuscript marks line 3
as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3–5,
some of them assuming the loss of a line after line 3. With the stanza as here given,
line 5 may well be spurious.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.44"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.44" class="pginternal">44</a>.</span> <i>Niflungs</i>: regarding the application of this term to the Burgundians cf. <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 11, and <i>Brot</i>, 17, and notes. The manuscript here spells the name with an initial N, as elsewhere,
but in stanza 83 the son of Hogni appears with the name “Hniflung.” In consequence,
some editors change the form in this stanza to “Hniflungs,” while others omit the
initial H in both cases. I have followed the manuscript, though admittedly its spelling
is illogical.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb516a">[<a href="#pb516a" class="pginternal">516</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.46"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.46" class="pginternal">46</a>.</span> The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition.
Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems
to have inspired the poet of the <i>Atlamol</i> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself. Kriemhild’s ferocity,
of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she
rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun’s is devoted to
the defense of her brothers.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.47"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.47" class="pginternal">47</a>.</span> Line 3 is very likely an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning
of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4–5. <i>Atli’s brother</i>: doubtless a reminiscence of the early tradition represented in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> by the slaying of Etzel’s brother, Blœdelin (the historical Bleda), by Dancwart.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb517a">[<a href="#pb517a" class="pginternal">517</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.48"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.48" class="pginternal">48</a>.</span> Line 3 may well be spurious, for it implies that Gunnar and Hogni were killed in
battle, whereas they were taken prisoners. Some editors, in an effort to smooth out
the inconsistency, change “themselves” in this line to “sound.” Line 5 has also been
questioned as possibly interpolated. <i>Niflungs</i>: on the spelling of this name in the manuscript and the various editions cf. note
on stanza 44.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.49"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.49" class="pginternal">49</a>.</span> Line 2 is probably an interpolation, and the original apparently lacks a word. There
is some obscurity as to the exact meaning of lines 4–5. <i>The two sons of Bera</i>: Snævar and Solar; <i>her brother</i> is Orkning; cf. stanza 28.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.50"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</span> <i>The warrior</i>: Atli. <i>Thirty</i>: perhaps an echo of the “thirty warriors” of Thjothrek (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i>, 5). Subtracting the eighteen killed by Snævar, Solar and Orkning (stanza 49), and
Vingi, killed by the whole company (stanza <span class="pageNum" id="pb518a">[<a href="#pb518a" class="pginternal">518</a>]</span>38), we have eleven left, as Atli says, but this does not allow much for the exploits
of Gunnar and Hogni, who, by this reckoning, seem to have killed nobody. The explanation
probably is that lines 4–5 of stanza 49 are in bad shape.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.51"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.51" class="pginternal">51</a>.</span> <i>Five brothers</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> speaks of four (not five) sons of Buthli, but names only Atli. Regarding the death
of the first two brothers cf. stanza 91 and note. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning
a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3–4 with stanza 52. Some insert lines 2–3
of stanza 52 ahead of lines 3–4 of stanza 51.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.52"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.52" class="pginternal">52</a>.</span> Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning
a new stanza, which is impossible unless something has been lost. <i>Gold</i>: the meaning of this half line is somewhat doubtful, but apparently Atli refers to
Sigurth’s treasure, which should have been his as Brynhild’s brother. <i>Sister</i>: Brynhild; regarding Guthrun’s indirect responsibility for Brynhild’s death cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 45 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb519a">[<a href="#pb519a" class="pginternal">519</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.53"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.53" class="pginternal">53</a>.</span> The manuscript does not name the speaker. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni: “Why speakest thou so? Thou
wast the first to break peace; thou didst take my kinswoman and starved her in a prison,
and murdered her and took her wealth; that was not kinglike; and laughable does it
seem to me that thou talkest of thy sorrow, and good shall I find it that all goes
ill with thee.” This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere
else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun’s mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece
elsewhere mentioned. Some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4–5, Grundtvig
adding a line after line 3 and two more after line 5. Other editors are doubtful about
the authenticity of either line 3 or line 5.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.54"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.54" class="pginternal">54</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb520a">[<a href="#pb520a" class="pginternal">520</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.56"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.56" class="pginternal">56</a>.</span> The text of the first half of line 3 is somewhat uncertain, but the general meaning
of it is clear enough.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.57"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.57" class="pginternal">57</a>.</span> <i>Beiti</i>: not elsewhere mentioned. The <i>Atlakvitha</i> version of this episode (stanzas 23–25) does not mention Beiti, and in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> the advice to cut out Hjalli’s heart instead of Hogni’s is given by an unnamed “counsellor
of Atli.” In the <i>Atlakvitha</i> Hjalli is actually killed; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> combines the two versions by having Hjalli first let off at Hogni’s intercession
and then seized a second time and killed, thus introducing the <i>Atlakvitha</i> episode of the quaking heart (stanza 24). The text of the first half of line 3 is
obscure, and there are many and widely varying suggestions as to the word here rendered
“sluggard.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.58"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.58" class="pginternal">58</a>.</span> Some editions mark line 5 as probably interpolated.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb521a">[<a href="#pb521a" class="pginternal">521</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.19.59"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.59" class="pginternal">59</a>.</span> <i>Cook</i>: the original word is doubtful. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> does not paraphrase lines 3–5; the passage may be a later addition, and line 5 is
almost certainly so.
</p>
<p id="n2.19.61"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.61" class="pginternal">61</a>.</span> It is probable that a stanza describing the casting of Gunnar into the serpents’

<p id="n2.19.62"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.62" class="pginternal">62</a>.</span> Regarding Gunnar’s harp-playing, and his death, cf. <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 27–30 and notes, and <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 34. <i>Toes</i> (literally “sole-twigs”): the <i>Volsungasaga</i> explains that Gunnar’s hands were bound. <i>Rafters</i>: thus literally, and probably correctly; Gering has an ingenious but unlikely theory
that the word means “harp.”
</p>
<p id="n2.19.63"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.19.63" class="pginternal">63</a>.</span> There is some doubt as to the exact meaning of line 2. After this line two lines

(cf. <i>Völundarkvitha</i>, 25 and 37), and the idea doubtless came from some such source, but probably the
poet inserted it in a line of his own composition to give an added touch of horror.
The <i>Volsungasaga</i> follows the <i>Atlamol</i> in including this incident.

In the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> he is called Aldrian, and is begotten by Hogni the night before his death. Aldrian
grows up and finally shuts Attila in a cave where he starves to death. The poet here
has incorporated the idea, which finds no parallel in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>, without troubling himself to straighten out the chronology.

incited him to fight with his brothers to win for himself the whole of Buthli’s land.
In stanza 91 Guthrun denies that she was to blame for Atli’s quarrels with his brothers.
The <i>Volsungasaga</i> reading supports this interpretation. The historical Attila did actually have his
brother, Bleda, killed in order to have the sole rule. <i>The treasure</i>: Sigurth’s hoard, which Atli claimed as the brother of Brynhild and husband of Guthrun,
Sigurth’s widow, but which Gunnar and Hogni kept for themselves, with, as Atli here
charges, Guthrun’s connivance. <i>My mother</i>: the only other reference to Atli’s mother is in <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 30, wherein she appears as the adder who stings Gunnar to death, and in the prose
passages based on that stanza.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two concluding poems in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> (<i>Guthrun’s Inciting</i>) and the <i>Hamthesmol</i> (<i>The Ballad of Hamther</i>), belong to a narrative cycle connected with those of Sigurth, the Burgundians, and
Atli (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note) by only the slenderest of threads. Of the three early historical
kings who gradually assumed a dominant place in Germanic legend, Ermanarich, king
of the East Goths in the middle of the fourth century, was actually the least important,
even though Jordanes, the sixth century author of <i>De Rebus Getecis</i>, compared him to Alexander the Great. Memories of his cruelty and of his tragic death,
however, persisted along with the real glories of Theoderich, a century and a half
later, and of the conquests of Attila, whose lifetime approximately bridged the gap
between Ermanarich’s death and Theoderich’s birth.
</p>
<p>Chief among the popular tales of Ermanarich’s cruelty was one concerning the death
of a certain Sunilda or Sanielh, whom, according to Jordanes, he caused to be torn
asunder by wild horses because of her husband’s treachery. Her brothers, Sarus and
Ammius, seeking to avenge her, wounded but failed to kill Ermanarich. In this story
is the root of the two Norse poems included in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>. Sunilda easily became the wife as well as the victim of the tyrant, and, by the
process of legend-blending so frequently observed, the story was connected with the
more famous one of the Nibelungs by making her the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun.
To account for her brothers, a third husband had to be found for Guthrun; the Sarus
and Ammius of Jordanes are obviously the Sorli and Hamther, sons of Guthrun and Jonak,
of the Norse poems. The blending of the Sigurth and Ermanarich legends probably, though
not certainly, took place before the story reached the North, in other words before
the end of the eighth century.
</p>
<p>Regarding the exact status of the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> and the <i>Hamthesmol</i> there has been a great deal of discussion. That they are closely related is obvious;
indeed the first parts of the two poems are nearly identical in content and occasionally
so in actual diction. The annotator, in his concluding prose note, refers to <span class="pageNum" id="pb537">[<a href="#pb537" class="pginternal">537</a>]</span>the second poem as the “old” ballad of Hamther, wherefore it has been assumed by some
critics that the composer of the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> used the <i>Hamthesmol</i>, approximately as it now stands, as the source of part of his material. The extant
<i>Hamthesmol</i>, however, is almost certainly a patchwork; part of it is in Fornyrthislag (cf. Introduction),
including most of the stanzas paralleled in the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, and likewise the stanza followed directly by the reference to the “old” ballad,
while the rest is in Malahattr. The most reasonable theory, therefore, is that there
existed an old ballad of Hamther, all in Fornyrthislag, from which the composer of
the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> borrowed a few stanzas as the introduction for his poem, and which the composer of
the extant, or “new,” <i>Hamthesmol</i> likewise used, though far more clumsily.
</p>
<p>The title “Guthrunarhvot,” which appears in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, really applies only to stanzas 1–8, all presumably borrowed from the “old” ballad
of Hamther. The rest of the poem is simply another Guthrun lament, following the tradition
exemplified by the first and second Guthrun lays; it is possible, indeed, that it
is made up of fragments of two separate laments, one (stanzas 9–18) involving the
story of Svanhild’s death, and the other (stanzas 19–21) coming from an otherwise
lost version of the story in which Guthrun closely follows Sigurth and Brynhild in
death. In any event the present title is really a misnomer; the poet, who presumably
was an eleventh century Icelander, used the episode of Guthrun’s inciting her sons
to vengeance for the slaying of Svanhild simply as an introduction to his main subject,
the last lament of the unhappy queen.
</p>
<p>The text of the poem in <i>Regius</i> is by no means in good shape, and editorial emendations have been many and varied,
particularly in interchanging lines between the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> and the <i>Hamthesmol</i>. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrases the poem with such fidelity as to prove that it lay before the compilers
of the saga approximately in its present form.</p>

<p class="first"><i><a href="#prose2.20" class="pginternal">Prose</a><span class="corr" title="Source: ," id="xd32e34683">.</span></i> In the manuscript the prose is headed “Of Guthrun,” the title “Guthrunarhvot” preceding
stanza 1. The prose introduction is used both by Snorri (<i>Skaldskaparmal</i>, chapter 42) and in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>. It would be interesting to know on what the annotator based this note, for neither
Bikki nor Randver is mentioned by name in either the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i> or the <i>Hamthesmol</i>. On the prose notes in general, cf. <i>Reginsmol</i>, introductory note. <i>Guthrun</i>: on the slaying of Atli by his wife, Guthrun, Sigurth’s widow, cf. <i>Atlamol</i>, 83–86 and notes. <i>Jonak</i>: a Northern addition to the legend, introduced to account for Svanhild’s half-brothers;
the name is apparently of Slavic origin. <i>Sorli</i>, <i>Erp</i>, and <i>Hamther</i>: Sorli and Hamther are the Sarus and Ammius of the Jordanes story (cf. introductory
note). The <i>Volsungasaga</i> follows this note in making Erp likewise a son of Guthrun, but in the <i>Hamthesmol</i> he is a son of Jonak by another wife. <i>Svanhild</i>: cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 54 and note. <i>Jormunrek</i> (Ermanarich): cf. introductory note. <i>Bikki</i>: the Sifka or Sibicho of the Gothic legends of Ermanarich, whose evil counsel always
brings trouble. <i>Randver</i>: in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> Jormunrek sends his son Randver with Bikki to seek Svanhild’s hand. On the voyage
home Bikki says to Randver: “It were right for you to have so fair a wife, and not
such an old man.” Randver was much pleased with this advice, “and he spake to her
with gladness, and she to him.” Thus the story becomes near of kin to those of Tristan
and Iseult and Paolo and Francesca. According to the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, Bikki told Ermanarich that a guilty love existed between his son and his young wife,
and presumably the annotator here meant as much by his vague “this.”

<p id="n2.20.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> The poet’s introduction of himself in this stanza is a fairly certain indication
of the relative lateness of the poem.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> <i>Idle</i>: a guess; a word is obviously missing in the original. The manuscript marks line
5 as beginning a new stanza, and lines 5–6 may well have been inserted from another
part of the “old” <i>Hamthesmol</i> (cf. <i>Hamthesmol</i>, 3).
</p>
<p id="n2.20.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Gunnar</i> and <i>Hogni</i>: cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>. Line 5 may be interpolated. <i>Hunnish</i>: here used, as often, merely as a generic term for all South Germanic peoples; the
reference is to the Burgundian Gunnar and Hogni.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> <i>Hamther</i>: some editions spell the name “Hamthir.” <i>Sigurth</i>, etc.: cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 21–24, and <i>Brot</i>, concluding prose. This stanza has been subjected to many conjectural rearrangements,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb540a">[<a href="#pb540a" class="pginternal">540</a>]</span>some editors adding two or three lines from the <i>Hamthesmol</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> <i>Bloody</i>: a guess; a word in the original is clearly missing, and the same is true of <i>all</i> in line 3. <i>Thy sons</i>: i.e., by killing her sons Erp and Eitil (cf. <i>Atlamol</i>, 72–74) Guthrun deprived Hamther, Sorli, and the second Erp of valuable allies in
avenging Svanhild’s death.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of one, two or
even more lines before the two here given.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> Line 1, identical with line 1 of stanza 4, may be interpolated <span class="pageNum" id="pb541a">[<a href="#pb541a" class="pginternal">541</a>]</span>here. <i>Spear-god</i>: warrior, i.e., Hamther himself. With this stanza the introductory <i>hvot</i> (“inciting”) ends, and stanza 9 introduces the lament which forms the real body of
the poem.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> Line 1 in the original is of uncertain meaning. Many editors assume the loss of a
line after line 1, and some completely reconstruct line 1 on the basis of a hypothetical
second line. <i>Princes</i>: Gunnar and Hogni.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Some editors assume the loss of one line, or more, before line 1. <i>Hniflungs</i>: Erp and Eitil, the sons of Guthrun and Atli. On the application of the name Niflung
(or, as later spelt, <span class="pageNum" id="pb542a">[<a href="#pb542a" class="pginternal">542</a>]</span>Hniflung) to the descendants of Gjuki, Guthrun’s father, cf. <i>Brot</i>, 17, note.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> <i>Norns</i>: the fates; cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, 8 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The manuscript omits the first half of line 4.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line 2, and make a separate stanza of
lines 3–5; Gering adds a sixth line of his own coining, while Grundtvig inserts one
between lines 3 and 4. The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza (cf. note on stanza
16). Stanzas 17 and 18 are very likely <span class="pageNum" id="pb543a">[<a href="#pb543a" class="pginternal">543</a>]</span>later interpolations, although the compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> knew them as they stand here. The whole passage depends on the shades of difference
in the meanings of the various superlatives: <i>harþastr</i>, “hardest”; <i>sárastr</i>, “sorest”; <i>grimmastr</i>, “grimmest,” and <i>hvassastr</i>, “keenest.” <i>Snakes</i>: cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i>.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> <i>The king</i>: Hogni; cf. <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 25. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Most editors agree that
there is a more or less extensive gap after stanza 18, and some of them contend that
the original ending of the poem is lost, stanzas 19–21 coming from a different poem,
probably a lament closely following Sigurth’s death.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza, and it immediately
follows the fragmentary line 3 of stanza 18. The resemblance between stanzas 19–21
and stanzas 64–69 of <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i> suggests that, in some otherwise lost version of the story, Guthrun, like Brynhild,
sought to die soon after Sigurth’s death. <i>Thy steed</i>: Guthrun’s appeal to the dead Sigurth to ride back to earth to meet her is reminiscent
of the episode related in <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i>, 39–48. The promise mentioned in stanza 20 is spoken of elsewhere only in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase of this passage.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb544a">[<a href="#pb544a" class="pginternal">544</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.20.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> Perhaps something has been lost between stanzas 20 and 21, or possibly stanza 21,
while belonging originally to the same poem as stanzas 19 and 20, did not directly
follow them. <i>Sore-pressed</i>: a guess; a word seems to have been omitted in the original.
</p>
<p id="n2.20.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.20.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> Words of the poet’s, like stanza 1, and perhaps constituting a later addition. Many
editors assume the loss of a line after line 3. The meaning, of course, is that the
poet hopes the story of Guthrun’s woes will make all other troubles seem light by
comparison.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Hamthesmol</i>, the concluding poem in the <i lang="la">Codex Regius</i>, is on the whole the worst preserved of all the poems in the collection. The origin
of the story, the relation of the <i>Hamthesmol</i> to the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, and of both poems to the hypothetical “old” <i>Hamthesmol</i>, are outlined in the introductory note to the <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>. The <i>Hamthesmol</i> as we have it is certainly not the “old” poem of that name; indeed it is so pronounced
a patchwork that it can hardly be regarded as a coherent poem at all. Some of the
stanzas are in Fornyrthislag, some are in Malahattr, one (stanza 29) appears to be
in Ljothahattr, and in many cases the words can be adapted to any known metrical form
only by liberal emendation. That any one should have deliberately composed such a
poem seems quite incredible, and it is far more likely that some eleventh century
narrator constructed a poem about the death of Hamther and Sorli by piecing together
various fragments, and possibly adding a number of Malahattr stanzas of his own.
</p>
<p>It has been argued, and with apparently sound logic, that our extant <i>Hamthesmol</i> originated in Greenland, along with the <i>Atlamol</i>. In any case, it can hardly have been put together before the latter part of the
eleventh century, although the “old” <i>Hamthesmol</i> undoubtedly long antedates this period. Many editors have attempted to pick out the
parts of the extant poem which were borrowed from this older lay, but the condition
of the text is such that it is by no means clear even what stanzas are in Fornyrthislag
and what in Malahattr. Many editors, likewise, indicate gaps and omissions, but it
seems doubtful whether the extant <i>Hamthesmol</i> ever had a really consecutive quality, its component fragments having apparently
been strung together with little regard for continuity. The notes indicate some of
the more important editorial suggestions, but make no attempt to cover all of them,
and the metrical form of the translation is often based on mere guesswork as to the
character of the original lines and stanzas. Despite the chaotic state of the text,
however, the underlying narrative is reasonably clear, and the story can be followed
with no great difficulty.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first" id="n2.21.1"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.1" class="pginternal">1</a>.</span> This stanza looks like a later interpolation from a totally unrelated source. <i>Sorrow of elves</i>: the sun; cf. <i>Alvissmol</i>, 16 and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.2"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.2" class="pginternal">2</a>.</span> Some editors regard lines 1–2 as interpolated, while others question line 3. <i>Guthrun</i>, etc.: regarding the marriage of Jonak and Guthrun (daughter of Gjuki, sister of
Gunnar and Hogni, and widow first of Sigurth and then of Atli), and the sons of this
marriage, Hamther and Sorli (but not Erp), cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, introductory prose and note.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.3"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.3" class="pginternal">3</a>.</span> <i>Svanhild</i> and <i>Jormunrek</i>: regarding the manner in which Jormunrek (Ermanarich) married Svanhild, daughter
of Sigurth and Guthrun, and afterwards had her trodden to death by horses, cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, introductory note. Lines 3–4 are identical with lines 5–6 of <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, 2.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.4"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.4" class="pginternal">4</a>.</span> These two lines may be all that is left of a four-line stanza. <span class="pageNum" id="pb547a">[<a href="#pb547a" class="pginternal">547</a>]</span>The manuscript and many editions combine them with stanza 5, while a few place them
after stanza 5 as a separate stanza, reversing the order of the two lines. <i>Kings of the folk</i>: Guthrun’s brothers, Gunnar and Hogni, slain by Atli.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.5"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.5" class="pginternal">5</a>.</span> Cf. note on stanza 4; the manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza.
<i>Scather of twigs</i>: poetic circumlocution for the wind (cf. <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>, chapter 27), though some editors think the phrase here means the sun. Some editors
assume a more or less extensive gap between stanzas 5 and 6.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.6"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.6" class="pginternal">6</a>.</span> Lines 1–3 are nearly identical with lines 1–3 of <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, 4. On the death of <i>Sigurth</i> cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 21–24, and <i>Brot</i>, concluding prose. The word <i>thy</i> in line 3 is omitted in the original.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.7"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.7" class="pginternal">7</a>.</span> Lines 1–2 are nearly identical with lines 4–5 of <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, 4. The manuscript, followed by many editions, indicates line 3 and not line 1 as
beginning a stanza.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb548a">[<a href="#pb548a" class="pginternal">548</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.8"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.8" class="pginternal">8</a>.</span> Some editors regard this stanza as interpolated. <i>Erp</i> and <i>Eitil</i>: regarding Guthrun’s slaying of her sons by Atli, cf. <i>Atlamol</i>, 72–75. The Erp here referred to is not to be confused with the Erp, son of Jonak,
who appears in stanza 13. The whole of stanza 8 is in doubtful shape, and many emendations
have been suggested.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.10"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.10" class="pginternal">10</a>.</span> Some editors assign this speech to Hamther. <i>Brothers</i>: Gunnar and Hogni. <i>Boys</i>: Erp and Eitil.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb549a">[<a href="#pb549a" class="pginternal">549</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.11"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.11" class="pginternal">11</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 21, and some editors take the word here
rendered “fame-glad one” (hróþrglǫþ) to be a proper name (Jormunrek’s mother or his
concubine). The <i>Volsungasaga</i>, however, indicates that Guthrun at this point “had so fashioned their war-gear that
iron would not bite into it, and she bade them to have nought to do with stones or
other heavy things, and told them that it would be ill for them if they did not do
as she said.” The substance of this counsel may well have been conveyed in a passage
lost after line 3, though the manuscript indicates no gap. It is by being stoned that
Hamther and Sorli are killed (stanza 26). On the other hand, the second part of line
3 may possibly mean “if silent ye are not,” in which case the advice relates to Hamther’s
speech to Jormunrek and Sorli’s reproach to him thereupon (stanzas 25 and 27). <i>Steps</i>: the word in the original is doubtful. Line 3 is thoroughly obscure. Some editors
make a separate stanza of lines 3–5, while others question line 5.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.12"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</span> Many editors assume the loss of a line after line 1. In several editions lines 2–3
are placed after line 2 of stanza 18. <i>Hunnish</i>: the word meant little more than “German”; cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, 3 and note.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb550a">[<a href="#pb550a" class="pginternal">550</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.13"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.13" class="pginternal">13</a>.</span> In the manuscript these two lines follow stanza 16; some editors insert them in place
of lines 2–3 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. <i>The man so wise</i>: Erp, here represented as a son of Jonak but not of Guthrun, and hence a half-brother
of Hamther and Sorli. There is nothing further to indicate whether or not he was born
out of wedlock, as intimated in stanza 16. Some editors assign line 3 to Hamther,
and some to Sorli.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.14"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.14" class="pginternal">14</a>.</span> The stanza is obviously defective. Many editors add Erp’s name in line 1, and insert
between lines 2 and 3 a line based on stanza 15 and the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase: “As a flesh-grown hand   |   another helps.” In the <i>Volsungasaga</i>, after Erp’s death, Hamther stumbles and saves himself from falling with his hand,
whereupon he says: “Erp spake truly; I had fallen had I not braced myself with my
hand.” Soon thereafter Sorli has a like experience, one foot slipping but the other
saving him from a fall. “Then they said that they had done ill to Erp, their brother.”
</p>
<p id="n2.21.15"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.15" class="pginternal">15</a>.</span> Many editions attach these two lines to stanza 14, while a few assume the loss of
two lines.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.16"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.16" class="pginternal">16</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza stands between stanzas 12 and 13. Some editors make
line 4 a part of Erp’s speech.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb551a">[<a href="#pb551a" class="pginternal">551</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.17"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.17" class="pginternal">17</a>.</span> The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza. <i>The giantess</i>: presumably the reference is to Hel, goddess of the dead, but the phrase is doubtful.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.18"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.18" class="pginternal">18</a>.</span> In the manuscript these two lines are followed by stanza 19 with no indication of
a break. Some editions insert here lines 2–3 of stanza 12, while others assume the
loss of two or more lines.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.19"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</span> Cf. note on stanza 18. <i>Ill way</i>: very likely the road leading through the gate of Jormunrek’s town at which Svanhild
was trampled to death. <i>Sister’s son</i>: many editors change the text to read “stepson,” for the reference is certainly to
Randver, son of Jormunrek, hanged by his father on Bikki’s advice (cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, introductory note). <i>Wolf-tree</i>: the gallows, the wolf being symbolical of outlaws. <i>Cranes’-bait</i>: presumably either snakes or worms, but the passage is doubtful.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb552a">[<a href="#pb552a" class="pginternal">552</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.20"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.20" class="pginternal">20</a>.</span> Many editors assume the loss of a line after line 3. <i>The warrior</i>: presumably a warder or watchman, but the reference may be to Hamther himself.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.21"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.21" class="pginternal">21</a>.</span> The word here rendered <i>men</i> (line 1) is missing in the original, involving a metrical error, and various words
have been suggested.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.22"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</span> Line 2 in the original is thoroughly obscure; some editors directly reverse the meaning
here indicated by giving the line a negative force, while others completely alter
the phrase rendered “his arms he called for” into one meaning “he stroked his cheeks.”
</p>
<p id="n2.21.23"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.23" class="pginternal">23</a>.</span> <i>Gjuki’s heirs</i>: the original has “the well-born of Gjuki,” and some editors have changed the proper
name to Guthrun, but the phrase apparently refers to Hamther and Sorli as Gjuki’s
grandsons. In the manuscript this stanza is followed by stanza 11, <span class="pageNum" id="pb553a">[<a href="#pb553a" class="pginternal">553</a>]</span>and such editors as have retained this arrangement have had to resort to varied and
complex explanations to account for it.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.24"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.24" class="pginternal">24</a>.</span> Editors have made various efforts to reconstruct a four-line stanza out of these
two lines, in some cases with the help of lines borrowed from the puzzling stanza
11 (cf. note on stanza 23). Line 2 in the original is doubtful.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.25"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.25" class="pginternal">25</a>.</span> Some editors mark line 1 as an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as beginning
a new stanza. As in the story told by Jordanes, Hamther and Sorli succeed in wounding
Jormunrek (here they cut off his hands and feet), but do not kill him.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.26"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.26" class="pginternal">26</a>.</span> The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as beginning a stanza. <i>Of the race of the gods</i>: the reference here is apparently to Jormunrek, but in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> the advice to kill Hamther and Sorli with stones, since iron will not wound them
(cf. note on stanza 11), comes from Othin, who enters the hall as an old man with
one eye.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb554a">[<a href="#pb554a" class="pginternal">554</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.27"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</span> In the manuscript this stanza is introduced by the same line as stanza 25: “Then
did Hamther speak forth,   |   the haughty of heart,” but the speaker in this case
must be Sorli and not Hamther. Some editors, however, give lines 1–2 to Hamther and
lines 3–4 to Sorli. <i>Bag</i>: i.e., Hamther’s mouth; cf. note on stanza 11. The manuscript indicates line 3 as
beginning a new stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.28"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.28" class="pginternal">28</a>.</span> Most editors regard stanzas 28–30 as a speech by Hamther, but the manuscript does
not indicate the speaker, and some editors assign one or two of the stanzas to Sorli.
Lines 1–2 are quoted in the <i>Volsungasaga</i>. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza. <i>Erp</i>: Hamther means that while the two brothers had succeeded only in wounding Jormunrek,
Erp, if he had been with them, would have killed him. Lines 3–4 may be a later interpolation.
<i>Norns</i>: the fates; the word used in the original means the goddesses of ill fortune.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb555a">[<a href="#pb555a" class="pginternal">555</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n2.21.29"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.29" class="pginternal">29</a>.</span> This is almost certainly an interpolated Ljothahattr stanza, though some editors
have tried to expand it into the Fornyrthislag form. <i>Hounds of the Norns</i>: wolves.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.30"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.30" class="pginternal">30</a>.</span> Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.
</p>
<p id="n2.21.31"><span class="parNum"><a href="#lg2.21.31" class="pginternal">31</a>.</span> Apparently a fragment of a stanza from the “old” <i>Hamthesmol</i> to which the annotator’s concluding prose note refers. Some editors assume the loss
of two lines after line 2.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Introductory Note</i>
</p>
<p>The pronunciations indicated in the following index are in many cases, at best, mere
approximations, and in some cases the pronunciation of the Old Norse is itself more
or less conjectural. For the sake of clarity it has seemed advisable to keep the number
of phonetic symbols as small as possible, even though the result is occasional failure
to distinguish between closely related sounds. In every instance the object has been
to provide the reader with a clearly comprehensible and approximately correct pronunciation,
for which reason, particularly in such matters as division of syllables, etymology
has frequently been disregarded for the sake of phonetic clearness. For example, when
a root syllable ends in a long (double) consonant, the division has arbitrarily been
made so as to indicate the sounding of both elements (e.g., Am-ma, not Amm-a).
</p>
<p>As many proper names occur in the notes but not in the text, and as frequently the
more important incidents connected with the names are outlined in notes which would
not be indicated by textual references alone, the page numbers include all appearances
of proper names in the notes as well as in the text.
</p>
<p>The following general rules govern the application of the phonetic symbols used in
the index, and also indicate the approximate pronunciation of the unmarked vowels
and consonants.

<p>No attempt has been made to differentiate between the short open “o” and the short
closed “o,” which for speakers of English closely resemble one another.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Consonants.</span> The consonants are pronounced approximately as in English, with the following special
points to be noted:
</p>
<p><i>G</i> is always hard, as in “get,” never soft, as in “gem;” following “n” it has the same
sound as in “sing.”
</p>
<p><i>J</i> is pronounced as <i>y</i> in “young.”
</p>
<p><i>Th</i> following a vowel is soft, as in “with;” at the beginning of a word or following
a consonant it is hard, as in “thin.”
</p>
<p>The long (doubled) consonants should be pronounced as in Italian, both elements being
distinctly sounded; e.g., “Am-ma.”
</p>
<p><i>S</i> is always hard, as in “so,” “this,” never soft, as in “as.”
</p>
<p><i>H</i> enters into combinations with various following consonants; with “v” the sound is
approximately that of <i>wh</i> in “what”; with “l,” “r” and “n” it produces sounds which have no exact English equivalents,
but which can be approximated by pronouncing the consonants with a marked initial
breathing.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Accents.</span> The accented syllable in each name is indicated by the acute accent (′). In many
names, however, and particularly in compounds, there is both a primary and a secondary
accent, and where this is the case the primary stress is indicated by a double acute
accent (″) and the secondary one by a single acute accent (′). To avoid possible confusion
with the long vowel marks used in Old Norse texts, the accents are placed, not over
the vowels, but after the accented syllables.
